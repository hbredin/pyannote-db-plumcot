galadriel I amar prestar aen… The world is changed. Han mathon ne nen… I feel it in the water. Han mathon ne chae… I feel it in the Earth. A han noston ned gwilith… I smell it in the air.
galadriel Much that once was is lost. For none now live who remember it.
galadriel It began with the forging of the great rings.
galadriel Three were given to the Elves, immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.
galadriel Seven to the Dwarf lords, great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.
galadriel And nine, nine rings were gifted to the race of Men — who above all else, desire power.
galadriel For within these rings was bound the strength and will to govern each race.
galadriel But they were all of them deceived, for another ring was made.
galadriel In the land of Mordor, in the fires of Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged in secret a master ring, to control all others.
galadriel And into this Ring, he poured his cruelty, his malice, and his will to dominate all life. One Ring to rule them all.
galadriel One by one, the free lands of Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. A last alliance of Men and Elves marched against the armies of Mordor, and on the slopes of Mount Doom they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth.
goblin_ Tangado haid! Leithio i philinn! (Hold positions! Fire arrows!)
galadriel Victory was near.
galadriel But the power of the Ring could not be undone.
galadriel It was in this moment, when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the King, took up his father's sword.
galadriel Sauron, the enemy of the free-peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated.
galadriel The Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever. But the hearts of Men are easily corrupted. And the Ring of Power has a will of its own.
galadriel It betrayed Isildur…
galadriel …to his death.
galadriel And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost.
galadriel History became legend, legend became myth, and for two and a half thousand years, the Ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier My Precious.
galadriel The Ring came to the creature Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there, it consumed him.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier It came to me, my own, my love, my own, my precious! Gollum!
galadriel The Ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For five hundred years it poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept back into the forest of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the east, whispers of a nameless fear, and the Ring of Power perceived its time had now come. It abandoned Gollum.
galadriel But something happened then the Ring did not intend. It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable.
king_of_the_dead What's this?
galadriel A Hobbit
king_of_the_dead A ring!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Lost! My precious is lost!
galadriel For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

bilbo Ahrrmm… The twenty-second day of September in the year fourteen-hundred, by Shire-reckoning. Bag End, Bagshot Row, Hobbiton, Westfarthing, the Shire, Middle-Earth. The Third Age of this world.
king_of_the_dead There and Back Again. A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.
king_of_the_dead Now… where to begin? Ah, yes.
bilbo Concerning Hobbits.
bilbo Hobbits have been living and farming in the four Farthings of the Shire for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Big Folk — Middle-Earth being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Hobbits must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.
king_of_the_dead Frodo! Someone at the door!
bilbo In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Hobbits' only real passion is for food.
bilbo A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of ales, and the smoking of pipe-weed. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled earth. For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.
bilbo And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint.
bilbo But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.
king_of_the_dead Frodo! The door!
king_of_the_dead Sticklebacks! Where is that boy? Frodo!
gondorian_ranger [humming] Down from the door where it began. And I must follow if I can.
gandalf The road goes ever on and on, Down from the door where it began. Now far ahead the road has gone, And I must follow if I can…
wildman [folding his arms] You're late!
gondorian_ranger A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins. Nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to.
wildman [leaps onto cart and hugs the old man] It's wonderful to see you Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger [laughs] Ooh! You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?
gondorian_ranger So, how is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a party of special magnificence.
wildman You know Bilbo. He's got the whole place in an uproar.
gondorian_ranger Well, that should please him! (chuckles)
wildman Half the Shire's been invited. And the rest of them are turning up anyway.
bilbo And so, life in the Shire goes on, very much as it has this past Age… full of its own comings and goings, with change coming slowly, if it comes at all.
bilbo For things are made to endure in the Shire, passing from one generation to the next. There's always been a Baggins, living here under the Hill… in Bag End. And there always will be.
wildman To tell you the truth, Bilbo's been a bit odd lately. I mean, more than usual. He's taken to locking himself in his study. He spends hours and hours poring over old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.
king_of_the_dead Where's it gone?
frodo He's up to something.
wildman All right then keep your secrets.
gondorian_ranger Hrrrmmph.
wildman But I know you have something to do with it.
gondorian_ranger Good gracious me!
wildman Before you came along we Bagginses were very well thought of.
gondorian_ranger Indeed?
wildman Never had any adventures or did anything unexpected.
gondorian_ranger If you're referring to the incident with the dragon, I was barely involved. All I did was give your uncle a little nudge out of the door.
wildman Whatever you did, you've been officially labeled a disturber of the peace.
gondorian_ranger Oh really?
hobbit_children#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Gandalf! Gandalf! Fireworks? Gandalf?
hobbit_children#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Awwww.
wildman Gandalf, I'm glad you're back.
gondorian_ranger So am I, dear boy! So am I.
voice_of_the_ring The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger Whoa, whoa.
king_of_the_dead No thank you! We don't want any more visitors, well-wishers or distant relations!
gondorian_ranger And what about very old friends?
bilbo Gandalf?
gondorian_ranger Bilbo Baggins!
gondorian_ranger Good to see you! One hundred and eleven years old — who would believe it? You haven't aged a day.
king_of_the_dead Come on, come in! Welcome, welcome! Oh, here we are.
king_of_the_dead Tea? Or maybe something a little stronger?
bilbo I've got a few bottles of the Old Winyard left. Twelve ninety-six — very good year. Almost as old as I am! Hahaha!
king_of_the_dead It was laid down by my father. What say we open one, eh?
gondorian_ranger Just tea, thank you.
king_of_the_dead I was expecting you sometime last week! Not that it matters, you come and go as you please. Always have done and always will. You caught me a bit unprepared, I'm afraid. We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle… Oh, there's some cheese here — oh no, that won't do. Err, we got raspberry jam and an apple tart… Not much for afters, I'm afraid. Oh, no — we're all right! I've found some sponge-cake. I could make you some eggs if you like — oh. Gandalf?
gondorian_ranger Just tea, thank you.
king_of_the_dead Oh, right! [with mouthful of sponge-cake] You don't mind if I eat, do you?
gondorian_ranger Oh no, not at all.
king_of_the_dead [whispers] I'm not at home!
king_of_the_dead It's the Sackville-Bagginses!
sackville_baggins#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 I know you're in there!
king_of_the_dead They're after the house. They've never forgiven me for living this long!
king_of_the_dead I've got to get away from these confounded relatives hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace!
king_of_the_dead I want to see mountains again, mountains Gandalf! And then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book. Oh, tea! (He hurries to prepare the tea.)
gondorian_ranger So, you mean to go through with your plan, then.
king_of_the_dead Yes, yes. It's all in hand. All the arrangements are made.
king_of_the_dead Oh, thank you.
gondorian_ranger Frodo suspects something.
king_of_the_dead 'Course he does. He's a Baggins! Not some block-headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle.
gondorian_ranger You will tell him, won't you?
king_of_the_dead Yes, yes.
gondorian_ranger He's very fond of you.
king_of_the_dead I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. (chuckles) I think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire
king_of_the_dead I'm old, Gandalf. I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart.
king_of_the_dead I feel thin — sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread.
king_of_the_dead I need a holiday — a very long holiday — and I don't expect I shall return. In fact, I mean not to!
king_of_the_dead Old Toby. The finest weed in the Southfarthing.
king_of_the_dead Ahh! Gandalf, my old friend. This will be a night to remember!
voice_of_the_ring The Fellowship of the Ring
king_of_the_dead [greeting his guests inside the marquee] Hello, hello, Fatty Bolger, lovely to see you! Welcome, welcome!
wildman Go on Sam! Ask Rosie for a dance!
easterling I think I'll just have another ale.
wildman Oh no you don't! Go on!
gondorian_ranger [setting off a firework] Whoa!
king_of_the_dead There I was, at the mercy of three monstrous trolls! And they were all arguing amongst themselves about how they were going to cook us, whether it be turned on a spit or whether they should sit on us one by one and squash us into jelly.
king_of_the_dead They spent so much time arguing the wither-tos and why-fors, that the sun's first light cracked over the top of the trees — poof!
king_of_the_dead And turned them all to stone!
stable_hand Quickly!
gondorian_ranger Whoa! Up they go.
stable_hand No, no the big one, big one.
king_of_the_dead Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you! Welcome, welcome. Are all these children yours?
king_of_the_dead Good gracious. You have been productive!
sackville_baggins#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Bilbo?
king_of_the_dead S-S-Sackville-Bagginses!
king_of_the_dead Quickly! Hide!
king_of_the_dead Thank you my boy.
king_of_the_dead You're a good lad, Frodo.
king_of_the_dead I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am. Very selfish… I don't know why I took you in after your mother and father died, but it wasn't out of charity. I think it was because, of all my numerous relations, you were the one that showed real… spirit.
wildman Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?
king_of_the_dead No. Well, yes. But that's — that's — not the point. The point is, Frodo — you'll be all right.
pippin Done.
stable_hand You're supposed to stick it in the ground!
pippin It is in the ground.
stable_hand Outside!
pippin It was your idea!
frodo Look at that!
wildman Bilbo? Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!
king_of_the_dead Dragon? Nonsense! There hasn't been a dragon in these parts for a thousand years…
stable_hand That was good!
pippin Let's get another one!
frodo Aah!
gondorian_ranger Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took. I might have known.
voice_of_the_ring The Fellowship of the Ring
frodo Speech, Bilbo! Speech!
wildman Speech!
proudfoot Proudfeet!
king_of_the_dead Today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday!
frodo Happy birthday!
frodo Happy birthday!
king_of_the_dead Alas, eleventy-one years is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hobbits. [cheers abound.] I don't know half of you half as well as I should like, and I like less than half of you half as well as you deserve.
king_of_the_dead I, uh, I h-have things to do. [fidgets with the Ring behind his back. Whispers to himself] I've put this off for far too long.
king_of_the_dead [to the crowd] I regret to announce — this is The End. I am going now. I bid you all a very fond farewell. [whispers to Frodo] Goodbye.
frodo Ooh!
gandalf I suppose you think that was terribly clever.
king_of_the_dead Come on Gandalf! Did you see their faces?
gondorian_ranger There are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly.
king_of_the_dead It was just a bit of fun! Oh you're probably right, as usual. You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
gondorian_ranger Two eyes — as often as I can spare them.
king_of_the_dead I'm leaving everything to him.
gondorian_ranger What about this ring of yours, is that staying too?
king_of_the_dead Yes, yes. It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
king_of_the_dead No, wait, it's — here in my pocket.
king_of_the_dead Heh, isn't that, isn't that odd though? Yet, after all why not? Why shouldn't I keep it?
gondorian_ranger I think you should leave the ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard?
king_of_the_dead Well no… and yes!
king_of_the_dead Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it, its mine, I found it, it came to me!
gondorian_ranger There's no need to get angry.
king_of_the_dead Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! [caresses the ring] It's mine! My own, my precious.
gondorian_ranger Precious? Its been called that before, but not by you.
king_of_the_dead Argh! What business is it of yours what I do with my own things!
gondorian_ranger I think you've had that Ring quite long enough.
bilbo You — want it for yourself!
gondorian_ranger Bilbo Baggins!
gondorian_ranger Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks. I am not trying to rob you. I'm trying to help you.
gondorian_ranger All your long years we've been friends. Trust me as you once did, hmm? Let it go.
king_of_the_dead You're right Gandalf, the Ring must go to Frodo. It's late, the road is long.
king_of_the_dead Yes, it is time.
gondorian_ranger Bilbo…
king_of_the_dead Hmm?
gondorian_ranger The Ring is still in your pocket.
bilbo Oh, yes…
king_of_the_dead I've thought up an ending for my book. [turns to Gandalf at the door] 'And he lived happily ever after, to the end of his days.'
gondorian_ranger And I'm sure you will my dear friend.
king_of_the_dead Good bye, Gandalf.
gondorian_ranger Good bye, dear Bilbo.
king_of_the_dead The road goes ever on and on, down from the door where it began…
gondorian_ranger Until our next meeting.
bilbo Its mine, my own, my precious!
gondorian_ranger Riddles in the Dark.
wildman Bilbo! Bilbo!
gondorian_ranger My precious.
gondorian_ranger Precious…
wildman He's gone hasn't he? He talked for so long about leaving. I didn't think he'd really do it.
wildman Gandalf?
gondorian_ranger Hmm? [smiles at Frodo, noticing the Ring in Frodo's hand.] Bilbo's ring. He's gone to stay with the Elves. He's left you Bag End…
gondorian_ranger …along with all his possessions. The ring is yours now. Put it somewhere out of sight.
wildman Where are you going?
gondorian_ranger There are some things that I must see to.
wildman What things?
gondorian_ranger Questions. Questions that need answering.
wildman But you've only just arrived! I don't understand.
gondorian_ranger Neither do I.
gondorian_ranger Keep it secret. Keep it safe.
voice_of_the_ring The Fellowship of the Ring
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Shire! Baggins!
gondorian_ranger 'The Year thirty-four thirty-four of the Second Age. Here follows the account of Isildur, High King of Gondor and the finding of the Ring of Power.'
gondorian_ranger 'It has come to me, the One Ring. It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom. All those who follow in my bloodline shall be bound to its fate for I will risk no hurt to the Ring. It is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain.' [The Ring in Isildur's fingers seems to shrink] 'The markings upon the band begin to fade. The writing, which at first was as clear as red flame, has all but disappeared. A secret now that only fire can tell.'

wildman Young Mister Frodo, here, he's cracking! (Laughs)
second_hobbit#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 And proud of it! Cheers, Gaffer!

hobbit#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Goodnight.
easterling Goodnight, sweet maiden of the Golden Ale!
wildman Mind who you're sweet talking.
easterling Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.
wildman Does she?
easterling Goodnight Sam.
gondorian_ranger Goodnight, Mister Frodo.
wildman Is it secret?! Is it safe?!
gondorian_ranger What are you doing?!
gondorian_ranger Hold out your hand Frodo, it's quite cool.
wildman What can you see? Can you see anything?
wildman [turning the Ring over and over between his fingers] Nothing. There's nothing…
wildman Wait. There are markings.
gondorian_ranger It's some form of Elvish. I can't read it.
wildman There are few who can. The language is that of Mordor, which I will not utter here.
gondorian_ranger Mordor?
voice_of_the_ring In the common tongue it says, 'One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them. One Ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.'
gondorian_ranger The Fellowship of the Ring
wildman This is the One Ring. Forged by the Dark Lord Sauron in the fires of Mount Doom. Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.
gondorian_ranger Bilbo found it. In Gollum's cave.
wildman Yes. For sixty years the Ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping, prolonging his life, delaying old age. But no longer Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The Ring has awoken. It's heard its master's call.
gondorian_ranger But he was destroyed! Sauron was destroyed.
gondorian_ranger No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. His life force is bound to the Ring, and the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. His Orcs have multiplied. His fortress at Barad-Dûr is rebuilt in the land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this Ring to cover all the lands of a second darkness.
wildman He is seeking it, seeking it — all his thought is bent on it. The Ring yearns above all else to return to the hand of its master. They are one, the Ring and the Dark Lord. Frodo, he must never find it.
gondorian_ranger All right, we put it away. We keep it hidden. We never speak of it again. No one knows it's here, do they? Do they Gandalf?
gondorian_ranger There is one other who knew that Bilbo had the Ring. I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum. But the enemy found him first.
gollum I don't know how long they tortured him. But amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words…
wildman Shire! Baggins!
frodo Shire. Baggins. But that would lead them here!
wildman Who goes there?
gondorian_ranger Take it Gandalf! Take it!
wildman No, Frodo.
gondorian_ranger You must take it!
wildman You cannot offer me this Ring!
gondorian_ranger I'm giving it to you!
wildman Don't tempt me Frodo! I dare not take it. Not even to keep it safe. Understand Frodo, I would use this Ring from a desire to do good. But through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine.
gondorian_ranger But it cannot stay in the Shire!
wildman No! No, it can't.
gondorian_ranger What must I do?
wildman You must leave, and leave quickly.
gondorian_ranger Where? Where do I go?
wildman Get out of the Shire. Make for the village Bree.
gondorian_ranger Bree. What about you?
wildman I'll be waiting for you, at the Inn of the Prancing Pony.
gondorian_ranger And the Ring will be safe there?
gondorian_ranger I don't know Frodo. I don't have any answers. I must see the head of my order. He is both wise and powerful. Trust me Frodo, he'll know what to do.
gondorian_ranger You'll have to leave the name of Baggins behind you, for that name is not safe outside the Shire.
wildman Travel only by day. And stay off the road.
gondorian_ranger I can cut across country easily enough.
gondorian_ranger My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are amazing creatures! You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month, and yet after a hundred years, they can still surprise you.
gondorian_ranger [hears rustling of the leaves] Get down!
easterling Confound it all Samwise Gamgee! Have you been eavesdropping?!
gondorian_ranger I haven't dropped no eaves sir, honest. I was just cutting the grass under the window there, if you follow me.
easterling A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?
gondorian_ranger I heard raised voices.
easterling What did you hear? Speak!
gondorian_ranger N-n-n-nothing important. That is I heard a good deal about a Ring and a Dark Lord and something about the end of the world but… Please, Mister Gandalf sir, don't hurt me. Don't turn me into anythin' — unnatural.
voice_of_the_ring Noooo? [He turns a conspiratorial gaze upon Frodo.] Perhaps not. I have thought of a better use for you…
gondorian_ranger The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger Come along Samwise, keep up!
gondorian_ranger Be careful both of you. The enemy has many spies in his service
gondorian_ranger Never put it on, for the agents of the Dark Lord will be drawn to its power.
easterling Always remember, Frodo, the Ring is trying to get back to its master. It wants to be found.
wildman This is it.
easterling This is what?
wildman If take one more step, it'll be the farthest away from home I've ever been.
wildman Come on Sam. Remember what Bilbo used to say
rohan_refugee_elf Sam! Wood-Elves!
wildman a Galad ren i veniar hi' aladhremmin ennorath A Elbereth Gilthoniel ithil nâ thûl, ithil lîn hen
easterling (O Light to us that wander here Amid the world of woven trees O Elbereth Gilthoniel Clear are thy eyes and bright thy breath)
wildman They're going to the harbour beyond the White Towers. To the Grey Havens.
easterling They're leaving Middle-Earth.
easterling Never to return.
wildman I don't know why — it makes me sad.
easterling Everywhere I lie there's a dirty great root sticking into my back.
wildman Just shut your eyes, and imagine you're back in your own bed, with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.
voice_of_the_ring It's not working Mister Frodo. I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.
boromir_ Me neither, Sam.
boromir_ The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger Smoke rises from the mountain of Doom. The hour grows late and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel. For that is why you have come, is it not… my old friend?
boromir_ You are sure of this?
gondorian_ranger Beyond any doubt.
boromir_ So, the Ring of Power has been found.
gondorian_ranger All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose.
boromir_ Yet you did not have the wit to see it. Your love of the halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind.
boromir_ But we still have time. Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.
boromir_ Time?! What time do you think we have?
gondorian_ranger Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form, but his spirit has lost none of its potency.
boromir_ Concealed within his fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all — his gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf — a great Eye… lidless… wreathed in flame.
gondorian_ranger The Eye of Sauron.
boromir_ He is gathering all evil to him. Very soon he will summon an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle-Earth.
gondorian_ranger You know this? How?
boromir_ I have seen it.
gondorian_ranger A Palantír is a dangerous tool, Saruman.
boromir_ Why? Why should we fear to use it?
gondorian_ranger They are not all accounted for, the lost Seeing Stones. We do not know who else may be watching!
boromir_ [seats himself upon his throne] The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving. The Nine have left Minas Morgul.
gondorian_ranger The Nine!
boromir_ They crossed the River Isen on Midsummer's Eve, disguised as riders in black.
gondorian_ranger They've reached the Shire?!
boromir_ They will find the Ring… and kill the one who carries it.
boromir_ Frodo!
gondorian_ranger You did not seriously think that a hobbit could contend with the will of Sauron? There are none who can.
boromir_ Against the power of Mordor there can be no victory. We must join with him, Gandalf. We must join with Sauron. It would be wise, my friend.
voice_of_the_ring Tell me, 'friend', when did Saruman the wise abandon reason for madness?!
easterling I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. But you… have elected… the way of… pain!
easterling The Fellowship of the Ring
wildman Mister Frodo? Frodo! Frodo!
easterling I thought I'd lost you.
wildman What are you talking about?
easterling It's just something Gandalf said.
wildman What did he say?
pippin 'Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee!' And I don't mean to.
stable_hand Sam, we're still in the Shire! What could possibly happen?
easterling Frodo? Merry! It's Frodo Baggins.
wildman Hello Frodo!
easterling Get off him! [hauls Pippin off Frodo] Frodo? Are you all right?
farmer_maggot What's the meaning of this?
stable_hand You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!
pippin [brandishing a scythe] Hoi! You get back here! Wait till I get this through you! Get out of my fields! You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!
stable_hand 'Dunno why he is so upset. It's only a couple of carrots!
pippin And some cabbages. And those few bags of potatoes that we lifted last week and, and the mushrooms the week before!
easterling Yes Pippin! My point is, he is clearly overreactin'. Run!
stable_hand Ooh! That was close.
easterling Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!
pippin What?! That was just a detour, a shortcut.
pippin A shortcut to what?
stable_hand Mushrooms!
wildman That's mine!
wildman Here is a nice one Sam.
easterling I think we should get off the road.
stable_hand Get off the road! Quick!
easterling Shhh! Stop it! Be quiet!
wildman What was that?
pippin Anything?
stable_hand Nothing.
easterling What is going on?
wildman That Black Rider was looking for something… or someone. Frodo?
stable_hand Get down!
pippin I have to leave the Shire. Sam and I must get to Bree.
stable_hand Right. Buckleberry Ferry. Follow me.
easterling Run! This way, follow me! Run!
frodo Get the rope Sam!
wildman Frodo!
frodo Run Frodo!
easterling Go!
frodo Hurry!
wildman Frodo!
stable_hand Jump Frodo! Go on faster! Jump!

gatekeeper#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 What do you want?
wildman We're heading for the Prancing Pony.
gatekeeper#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 [opening the gate] Hobbits! Four hobbits! What business brings you to Bree?
galadriel#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 We wish to stay at the inn. Our business is our own.
wildman All right young sir, I meant no offence. 'Tis my job to ask question after nightfall. There's talk of strange folk abroad. Can't be too careful.
barliman_butterbur Out of the way! Watch where you're walking, young masters!
wildman Excuse me?
goblin Good evening, little masters! If you're looking for accommodation we've got some nice, cozy, hobbit-sized rooms available. Mister uh —
wildman — Underhill, my name's Underhill.
goblin Underhill. Yes…
easterling We're friends of Gandalf the Grey. Can you tell him we've arrived?
wildman Gandalf? Gandalf? Oh yes! I remember
legolas What do we do now?
pippin Sam. He'll be here. He'll come.
stable_hand [to Merry coming from the bar] Get, get out of my way.
pippin What's that?
easterling This my friend, is a pint.
easterling It comes in pints? I'm getting one.
wildman You had a whole half already!
goblin That fellow's done nothin' but stare at you since we arrived.
wildman [takes Butterbur aside] Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he?
voice_of_the_ring He's one of them rangers. Dangerous folk they are — wandering the wilds. What his right name is I've never heard, but around here, he's known as Strider.
pippin Strider.
pippin Baggins. Baggins. Baggins. Baggins! Baggins!…
pippin Baggins!
pippin [at the bar] Sure I know a Baggins. He's over there, Frodo Baggins.
eowyn He's my second cousin, once removed on his mother's side [listeners laugh, It works for him! yells one] and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side, if you follow me.
wildman Steady on, Frodo!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 You cannot hide! I see you! There is no life in the void, only death!
wildman Ah!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 You draw far too much attention to yourself Mister 'Underhill'!
wildman What do you want?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 A little more caution from you. That is no trinket you carry.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 I carry nothing!
wildman Indeed.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 I can avoid being seen if I wish. But to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.
wildman Who are you?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Are you frightened?
easterling Yes.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Not nearly frightened enough. I know what hunts you.
wildman Let him go! Or I'll have you Longshanks!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 (sheaths his sword) You have a stout heart little hobbit, but that will not save you. You can no longer wait for the wizard Frodo. They're coming.
strider#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 What are they?
strider#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 They were once Men. Great kings of Men.
voice_of_the_ring Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them nine Rings of Power. Blinded by their greed, they took them without question. One by one falling into darkness.
wildman Now they are slaves to his will. They are the Nazgûl, Ringwraiths, neither living nor dead. At all times they feel the presence of the Ring. Drawn to the power of the One. They will never stop hunting you.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 The Fellowship of the Ring
stable_hand Where are you taking us?
wildman Into the wild.
stable_hand How do we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf?
wildman I think a servant of the Enemy would look fairer and feel fouler.
easterling He's foul enough!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 We have no choice but to trust him.
easterling But where is he leading us?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 To Rivendell, Master Gamgee. To the House of Elrond.
pippin Did you hear that? Rivendell! We're going to see the Elves!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Gentlemen, we do not stop 'till nightfall.
stable_hand What about breakfast?
pippin We've already had it.
stable_hand Don't think he knows about second breakfast Pip.
stable_hand What about elevenses? Luncheon? Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper? He knows about them doesn't he?
stable_hand I wouldn't count on it.
strider#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Pippin!
wildman What do they eat — when they can't get Hobbit?
strider#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Tinúviel elvanui, Elleth alfirin ethelhael O hon ring finnil fuinui A renc gelebrin thiliol.
wildman (Tinúviel the elven-fair, Immortal maiden elven-wise, About him cast her night-dark hair, And arms like silver glimmering.)
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Who is she? This woman you sing of?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 'Tis the Lay of Lúthien. The Elf-maiden who gave her love to Beren, a mortal.
boromir_ What happened to her?
eowyn [looks away] She died.
first_orc#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Get some sleep, Frodo.
boromir_ The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth.
baby_gamgee Build me an army worthy of Mordor!
boromir_ What orders from Mordor my Lord? What does the Eye command?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 We have work to do.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 The trees are strong, my Lord. Their roots go deep.
stable_hand Rip them all down!
pippin This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl. We shall rest here tonight.
stable_hand These are for you. Keep them close. I'm going to have a look around. Stay here.
wildman My tomato's burst.
stable_hand Can I have some bacon?
easterling Okay. Want some tomatoes Sam?
wildman What are you doing?!
pippin Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.
all#together We saved some for you, Mister Frodo.
wildman Put it out, you fools! Put it out!
easterling Oh, that's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!
wildman Uh?!
wildman Go!
easterling [brandishing his sword] Back you devils!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Ah!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Oh Sam!
easterling Strider! Help him, Strider!
wildman This is beyond my skill to heal. He needs Elvish medicine.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Hurry!
wildman We're six days from Rivendell. He'll never make it!
voice_of_the_ring Gandalf…
gondorian_ranger Hold on, Frodo.
easterling Gandalf!
easterling The Fellowship of the Ring
pippin [whispering a final command] Gwaihir. Go, Gwaihir.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Look, Mister Frodo! It's Mister Bilbo's trolls!
stable_hand Mister Frodo? [to Strider] He's going cold!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Is he going to die?
easterling He's passing into the shadow world. He will soon become a wraith like them.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 They're close.
easterling Sam, do you know Athelas plant?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Athelas?
saruman Kingsfoil?
saruman Kingsfoil — aye, it's a weed.
saruman It may help to slow the poison. Hurry!
stable_hand What's this? A ranger caught off his guard?
saruman Frodo…. Im Arwen. Telin le thaed (I am Arwen. I have come to help you.)
easterling Lasto beth nîn. Tolo dan na ngalad (Hear my voice. Come back to the light.)
saruman Who is she?
saruman [kneels] Frodo!
stable_hand She's an Elf.
saruman He's fading!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 He's not going to last. We must get him to my father. I've been looking for you for two days.
saruman Where are you taking him?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 [gets up as Strider lifts Frodo up in his arms] There are five wraiths behind you. Where the other four are, I do not know.
pippin Dartho guin perian. Rych le ad tolthathon. (Stay with the Hobbits. I will send horses back for you.)
saruman Hon mabathon. Rochon ellint im. (I'm the faster rider. I'll take him.)
saruman Andelu i ven. (The road is too dangerous.)
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 What are they saying?
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Frodo fîr. Ae athradon i hir, tur gwaith nin beriatha hon. (Frodo's dying. If I can get across the river, the power of my people will protect him.)
saruman I do not fear them.
sam Be iest lîn. (As you wish.)
saruman Arwen, ride hard. Don't look back!
#unknown Noro lim, Asfaloth, noro lim! (Ride fast, Asfaloth, ride fast!)
saruman What are you doing?! Those wraiths are still out there!
saruman Noro lim, Asfaloth! (Ride faster, Asfaloth!)
saruman Give up the halfling, she-Elf!
arwen [draws her sword in challenge] If you want him, come and claim him!
voice_of_the_ring Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen, dan in Ulair! Nin o Chithaeglir, lasto beth daer, Rimmo nin Bruinen, dan in Ulair!
goblin_ (Waters of the Misty Mountains, listen to the great word, flow waters of Loudwater, against the Ringwraiths!)
wildman No! Frodo… No! Frodo, don't give in! Not now!
gandalf What grace is given me, let it pass to him, let him be spared — save him.
wildman The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger Lasto beth nîn. Tolo dan na ngalad. (Hear my voice, come back to the light.)
wildman Where am I?
gondorian_ranger You are in the house of Elrond. And it is ten o'clock in the morning, on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know.
boromir_ Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger Yes… I'm here. And you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit!
boromir_ What happened, Gandalf? Why didn't you meet us?
wildman Oh I'm sorry Frodo… I was delayed.
gondorian_ranger Friendship with Saruman is not lightly thrown aside. One ill turn deserves another. It is over! Embrace the power of the Ring… or embrace your own destruction!
easterling [slowly raises himself as the shadowy form of an eagle appears in the background] There is only one Lord of the Ring! Only one who can bend it to his will. And he… does… not… share… power!
wildman So you have chosen… death.
easterling Gandalf? What is it?
gondorian_ranger Nothing, Frodo.
easterling Frodo! Frodo!
gondorian_ranger Sam!
goblin_ Bless you, you're awake!
wildman Sam has hardly left your side.
king_of_the_dead We were that worried about you, weren't we Mister Gandalf?
king_of_the_dead By the skills of Lord Elrond, you're beginning to mend.
wildman [entering the room and smiles down at Frodo] Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.
king_of_the_dead Bilbo!
wildman Hello, Frodo my lad!
king_of_the_dead Oh!
sam 'There and Back Again
wildman I meant to go back… wander the paths of Mirkwood… visit Laketown… see the Lonely Mountain again. But age it seems, has finally caught up with me.
easterling I miss the Shire. I spent all my childhood pretending I was off somewhere else… off with you on one of your adventures! My own adventure turned out to be quite different. I'm not like you, Bilbo.
wildman [pats Frodo's cheek] My dear boy.
easterling Now what have I forgotten?
wildman Packed already?
easterling No harm in being prepared.
wildman I thought you wanted to see the Elves, Sam.
voice_of_the_ring I do!
goblin_ More than anything.
gondorian_ranger I did! It's just… we did what Gandalf wanted didn't we? We got the Ring this far to Rivendell and then I thought, seein' as how you're on the mend, we'd be off soon. Off home.
goblin_ You're right Sam. We did what we set out to do. [shows the Ring on his palm] The Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I am ready to go home.
gondorian_ranger The Fellowship of the Ring
goblin_ His strength returns.
gondorian_ranger That wound will never fully heal. He will carry it the rest of his life.
goblin_ And yet to have come so far, still bearing the Ring, the hobbit has shown extraordinary resilience to its evil.
goblin_ It is a burden he should never have had to bear. We can ask no more of Frodo.
goblin_ Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's forces are massing in the east — his eye is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman you tell me has betrayed us. Our list of allies grows thin.
goblin_ His treachery runs deeper than you know. By foul craft Saruman has crossed Orcs with goblin-men, he's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard. An army that can move in sunlight and cover great distance at speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring.
gondorian_ranger This evil cannot be concealed by the power of the Elves. We do not have the strength to fight both Mordor and Isengard!
goblin_ Gandalf, the Ring cannot stay here.
goblin_ This peril belongs to all Middle-Earth. They must decide now how to end it.
goblin_ The time of the Elves is over — my people are leaving these shores. Who will you look to when we've gone? The Dwarves? They hide in their mountains seeking riches — they care nothing for the troubles of others.
goblin_ It is in Men that we must place our hope.
elrond Men? Men are weak.
goblin_ The race of Men is failing. The blood of Númenor is all but spent, its pride and dignity forgotten. It is because of Men the Ring survives. I was there Gandalf. I was there three thousand years ago…
goblin_ when Isildur took the Ring. I was there the day the strength of Men failed.
lothlorien_elf Isildur — hurry. Follow me.
goblin_ I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom, where the Ring was forged, the one place it could be destroyed.
elrond Cast it into the fire!
goblin_ Destroy it!
gondorian_ranger No.
goblin_ Isildur!
denethor It should've ended that day, but evil was allowed to endure.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Isildur kept the Ring. The line of kings is broken. There is no strength left in the world of Men. They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
denethor There is one who could unite them, one who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 He turned from that path long time ago. He has chosen exile.
denethor You are no Elf!
denethor The Men of the South are welcome here.
denethor Who are you?
denethor I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.
saruman Then we are here on a common purpose… (smiles) friend.
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 The shards of Narsil! The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand!
saruman It's still sharp!
#unknwon But no more than a broken heirloom!
saruman Why do you fear the past? You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himself. You are not bound to his fate.
party_hobbit The same blood flows in my veins. Same weakness.
saruman Your time will come. You will face the same evil, and you will defeat it. A si i-Dhúath ú-orthor, Aragorn. Ú or le a ú or nin. (The Shadow does not hold sway yet, Aragorn. Not over you and not over me.)
saruman Ely siriar, êl síla. Ai! Aníron Undómiel. Tiro! Êl eria e môr. I 'lîr en êl luitha 'úren. Ai! Aníron…
party_hobbit Renech i lu i erui govannen? (Do you remember when we first met?)
saruman Nauthannem i ned ol reniannen. (I thought I had strayed into a dream.)
party_hobbit [tenderly touches Aragorn's cheek] Gwenwin in enninath… U-arnech in naeth i si celich. (Long years have passed… You did not have the cares you carry now.)
saruman Renech i beth i pennen? (Do you remember what I told you?)
voice_of_the_ring [his fingers run across the pendant on her breast] You said you'd bind yourself to me. Forsaking the immortal life of your people.
goblin_ I choose a mortal life.
goblin_ You cannot give me this!
goblin_ It is mine to give to whom I will… like my heart.
denethor The Fellowship of the Ring
man#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Strangers from distant lands, friends of old. You have been summoned here to answer the threat of Mordor.
denethor Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of destruction. None can escape it. You will unite or you will fall.
legolas Each race is bound to this fate — this one doom. [gestures to the pedestal] Bring forth the Ring, Frodo.
goblin_ So it is true…
gondorian_ranger The Doom of Men.
goblin_ [rises to address the Council] In a dream, I saw the eastern sky grow dark. But in the West a pale light lingered. A voice was crying
gondorian_ranger Isildur's Bane.
gondorian_ranger Boromir!
denethor Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul.
boromir_ (One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to find them, One Ring to bring them all and in the Darkness bind them.)
party_hobbit Never before has any voice uttered the words of that tongue here in Imladris!
denethor (voice raspy from the force of the words and the language)
ringwraith The Ring is altogether evil!
denethor It is a gift. A gift to the foes of Mordor.
ringwraith Why not use this Ring? [paces] Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept the forces of Mordor at bay. By the blood of our people are your lands kept safe! Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy. Let us use it against him!
party_hobbit You cannot wield it! None of us can. The One Ring answers to Sauron alone. It has no other master.
gondorian_ranger And what would a ranger know of this matter?
goblin_ This is no mere ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance.
irolas Aragorn? This… is Isildur's heir?
irolas And heir to the throne of Gondor.
goblin_ Havo dad, Legolas. (Sit down, Legolas.)
voice_of_the_ring Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.
goblin_ You have only one choice. The Ring must be destroyed.
denethor Then what are we waiting for?
ringwraith Argh!
irolas The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Glóin, by any craft that we here possess. The Ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom. Only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came.
denethor Ash Nazg.
irolas One of you must do this.
irolas One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep. And the great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland. Riddled with fire and ash and dust. The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly!
gondorian_ranger [stands indignantly] Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The Ring must be destroyed!
mordor_orc [leaps to his feet] And I suppose you think you're the one to do it?!
wildman [rises] And if we fail, what then?! What happens when Sauron takes back what is his?!
wildman I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf!
wildman Never trust an Elf!
party_hobbit Do you not understand that while we bicker amongst ourselves, Sauron's power grows?! None can escape it! You'll all be destroyed!
party_hobbit Ash Nazg Durbatulûk! Ash Nazg Gimbatul! Ash Nazg Gimbatul! Ash Nazg Gimbatul!
denethor I will take it!
easterling I will take it!
elrond I will take the Ring to Mordor. Though — I do not know the way.
pippin_and_merry#together [rises] If by my life or death, I can protect you, I will.
stable_hand You have my sword.
pippin [walks over to them] You carry the fate of us all little one. If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done.
stable_hand Heh! [jumps from behind the bushes and joins them] Mister Frodo is not goin' anywhere without me!
goblin_ No indeed, it is hardly possible to separate you even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not.
pippin [emerges from behind the pillars to join them] Wait! We are coming too!
voice_of_the_ring You'd have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us!
goblin_ Anyway you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission, quest… thing.
goblin_ Well that rules you out Pip.
goblin_ Nine companions… So be it! You shall be the Fellowship of the Ring!
party_hobbit Great! Where are we going?
goblin_ The Fellowship of the Ring
king_of_the_dead Anirne hene beriad i chên în. Ned Imladris nauthant e le beriathar aen. (She wanted to protect her child. She thought that in Rivendell you would be safe.)
wildman In her heart, your mother knew you'd be hunted all your life. That you'd never escape your fate.
king_of_the_dead The skill of the Elves can reforge the sword of Kings, but only you have the power to wield it.
king_of_the_dead I do not want that power. I have never wanted it.
king_of_the_dead You are the last of that bloodline. There is no other.
king_of_the_dead My old sword, Sting! Here! Take it, take it!
king_of_the_dead It's so light!
goblin_ Yes… yea — made by the Elves, you know. The blade glows blue when Orcs are close. And it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful!
goblin_ Here's a pretty thing — Mithril! As light as a feather… and as hard as dragon scales! Let me see you put it on. Come on.
gondorian_ranger Oh… M-my old Ring! Oh, I sh-sh-should very much like… to hold it again, one last time.
frodo I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy… I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.
gondorian_ranger I'm sorry for everything!
voice_of_the_ring The Ring-bearer is setting out on the Quest of Mount Doom. On you who travel with him no oath nor bond is laid, to go further than you will.
gandalf Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May the blessings of Elves and Men and all free folk go with you.
boromir_ The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.
party_hobbit Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?
stable_hand Left.
pippin The Fellowship of the Ring
denethor We must hold this course west of the Misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there our road turns east to Mordor.
irolas Two, one, five. Good. Very good.
gondorian_ranger Move your feet.
denethor You look good, Pippin.
pippin Thanks.
denethor Faster!
denethor If anyone was to ask for my opinion, which I note they're not, I'd say we were taking the long way round. Gandalf, we could pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome.
stable_hand No Gimli, I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice.
pippin Come on. Good.
party_hobbit Aaaah!
pippin Sorry!
easterling Ahh!
irolas Get Him!
denethor For the Shire! Hold him! Hold him down! Merry!
ringwraith Gentlemen, that's enough.
party_hobbit [off screen, still in a mock battle] You've got my arm… you've got my arm!
denethor What is that?
party_hobbit Nothing, it's just a whiff of cloud.
gondorian_ranger [getting up from the ground, a hand on either Hobbit's shoulder] It's moving fast… against the wind.
gondorian_ranger Crebain from Dunland!
voice_of_the_ring Hide!
wildman Hurry!
aragorn Frodo! Hurry! Take cover!
boromir Spies of Saruman! The passage South is being watched.
party_hobbitparty_hobbit We must take the Pass of Caradhras.
denethor The Fellowship of the Ring
denethor Ungh!
boromir_ Boromir.
saruman_ It is a strange fate we should suffer so much fear and doubt… over so small a thing. Such a little thing.
boromir_ Boromir!
ringwraith Give the Ring to Frodo.
gondorian_ranger [holds out the Ring] As you wish…
party_hobbit … I care not.
gondorian_ranger So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails, where then will you go?
gondorian_ranger If the mountain defeats you, will you risk a more dangerous road?
boromir_ Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; nai yarvaxea rasselya! (Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your horn be bloodstained!)
denethor There is a fell voice on the air!
party_hobbit It's Saruman!
irolas He's trying to bring down the mountain! Gandalf, we must turn back!
saruman_ No!
boromir_ Losto Caradhras, sedho, hodo, nuitho i 'ruith! (Sleep, Caradhras, be still, lie still, hold your wrath!)
boromir_ Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse; Nai yarvaxea rasselya; taltuva notto-carinnar! (Wake up cruel Redhorn! May your bloodstained horn fall upon enemy heads!)
boromir_ We must get off the mountain! Make for the Gap of Rohan and take the west road to my city!
gandalf The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!
denethor If we cannot pass over the mountain, let us go under it. Let us go through the mines of Moria.
gondorian_ranger Moria… You fear to go into those mines.
wildman The Dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.
gondorian_ranger You know what they awoke in the darkness of Khazad-dûm
voice_of_the_ring Shadow and Flame!
gondorian_ranger Let the Ring bearer decide.
gondorian_ranger We cannot stay here! This will be the death of the Hobbits!
wildman Frodo?
gondorian_ranger We will go through the mines.
gondorian_ranger So be it.
wildman The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger Frodo, come and help an old man.
wildman How is your shoulder?
gondorian_ranger Better than it was.
irolas And the Ring?
irolas You feel its power growing, don't you? I've felt it too. You must be careful now. Evil will be drawn to you from outside the Fellowship. And, I fear, from within.
gondorian_ranger Who then do I trust?
ringwraith You must trust yourself. Trust your own strengths.
gondorian_ranger What do you mean?
gondorian_ranger There are many powers in this world, for Good or for Evil. Some are greater than I am. And against some I have not yet been tested.
gondorian_ranger The Walls… of Moria!
stable_hand Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
gondorian_ranger Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find them, if their secrets are forgotten.
gondorian_ranger Why doesn't that surprise me?
gondorian_ranger Now… let's see. Ithildin —
pippin It mirrors only starlight… and moonlight.
gondorian_ranger It reads 'The Doors of Durin — Lord of Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.'
pippin What do you suppose that means?
gondorian_ranger Oh, it's quite simple. If you are a friend, you speak the password, and the doors will open.
gondorian_ranger Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen! (Gate of the Elves, open now for me!)
party_hobbit Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen. (Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen to the word of my tongue.)
easterling Nothing's happening.
party_hobbit I once knew every spell in all the tongues of Elves… Men… and Orcs.
party_hobbit What are you going to do, then?
gondorian_ranger Knock your head against these doors, Peregrin Took! And if that does not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will try to find the opening words.
wildman Ando Eldarinwa… a lasta quettanya, Fenda Casarinwa… (Gate of Elves… listen to my word, Threshold of Dwarves…)
wildman [unhitching the pony's bridle] The Mines are no place for a pony, even one so brave as Bill.
gondorian_ranger Buh-bye Bill.
irolas Go on, Bill, go on. Don't worry Sam, he knows the way home.
irolas Do not disturb the water.
denethor Oh, it's useless!
irolas It's a riddle.
ringwraith Speak 'friend' and enter. What's the Elvish word for friend?
denethor Mellon…
denethor Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the fabled hospitality of the Dwarves! Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone. This, my friend, is the home of my cousin, Balin.
pippin_and_merry_and_sam#together And they call it a mine. A mine!
easterling This is no mine, it's a tomb!
wildman Oh! No! Noooo!
easterling Goblins!
stable_hand We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should never have come here.
stable_hand Now get out of here, get out!
wildman Frodo!
striderr#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Strider!
gondorian_ranger Help!
denethor [hacks at tentacle] Get off him! Strider!
party_hobbit Aragorn!
party_hobbit Frodo!
voice_of_the_ring Strider!
gondorian_ranger Yaghh!
gondorian_ranger Into the Mines!
gondorian_ranger Legolas!
gondorian_ranger Into the cave!
gondorian_ranger Run!
gondorian_ranger The Fellowship of the Ring
irolas We now have but one choice.
gondorian_ranger We must face the long dark of Moria. Be on your guard. There are older and fouler things than Orcs, in the deep places of the world.
stable_hand Quietly now. It's a four-day journey to the other side. Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.
gondorian_ranger The wealth of Moria was not in gold… or jewels…
party_hobbit …but Mithril.
pippin Bilbo had a shirt of Mithril rings that Thorin gave him.
stable_hand Oh, that was a kingly gift.
pippin Yes! I never told him, but its worth was greater than the value of the Shire.
easterling Pippin!
pippin I have no memory of this place.
stable_hand Hmm.
pippin Are we lost?
wildman No.
gandalf I think we are.
wildman Shh! Gandalf's thinking.
gondorian_ranger Merry?
wildman What?
gondorian_ranger I'm hungry.
gondorian_ranger There's something down there!
gondorian_ranger It's Gollum.
wildman Gollum?
gondorian_ranger He's been following us for three days.
gondorian_ranger He escaped the dungeons of Barad-Dûr!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Escaped? Or was set loose?
gondorian_ranger And now the Ring had drawn him here. He will never be rid of his need for it. He hates and loves the Ring, as he hates and loves himself.
gondorian_ranger Sméagol's life is a sad story. Yes, Sméagol he was once called. Before the Ring found him… before it drove him mad.
wildman It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when he had the chance!
gondorian_ranger [glancing sharply at Frodo] Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo's hand. Many that live deserve death, and some that die deserve life. Can you give it to them, Frodo?
gondorian_ranger Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise can not see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill…
stable_hand Gollum.
gondorian_ranger …before this is over.
gondorian_ranger The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.
gondorian_ranger I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
gondorian_ranger So do all who live to see such times, but that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us. There are other forces at work in this world, Frodo, besides the will of evil. Bilbo was meant to find the Ring, in which case you also were meant to have it. And that is an encouraging thought.
easterling [looks towards one of the doorways] Oh! It's that way.
irolas He's remembered!
gondorian_ranger No, but the air doesn't smell so foul down here.
gondorian_ranger If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.
voice_of_the_ring Let me risk a little more light.
irolas Behold
ringwraith Now there's an eye opener and no mistake.
gondorian_ranger Haugh!
gondorian_ranger Gimli!
gondorian_ranger [translating the runes on the tomb] 'Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of Moria.' He is dead then. It's as I feared.
gondorian_ranger The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger [chanting softly, sobbing] Kilmin malur ni zaram kalil ra narag. Kheled-zâram… Balin tazlifi.
gondorian_ranger [to Aragorn] We must move on, we cannot linger!
easterling [reading] 'They have taken the bridge… and the second hall.'
ringwraith 'We have barred the gates… but cannot hold them for long. The ground shakes.'
aragorn 'Drums… drums… in the deep.'
boromir_ 'We cannot get out. A shadow moves in the dark.'
gondorian_ranger 'We cannot get out…' [He glances at the last, single line, a scrawl fading out at the bottom of the page. Gandalf looks up in the uncomfortable silence.] 'They are coming!'
irolas [slams the book shut] Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next time and rid us of your stupidity!
easterling Frodo!
party_hobbit Orcs!
wildman Get back! You stay close to Gandalf!
party_hobbit They have a cave troll.
party_hobbit Yah!
wildman Argh! Let them come! There is one dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath!
pippin_and_merry#together [hits an Orc with skillet] I think I'm getting the hang of this.
easterling [seeing the eminent danger] Frodo!
easterling Aragorn? Aragorn!
party_hobbit Frodo!
easterling Yah!
wildman Ugh… uh!
party_hobbit Yaaahh!
gondorian_ranger [from a distance away] Frodo?
irolas Frodo!
gondorian_ranger Oh no!
voice_of_the_ring He's alive!
denethor I'm all right, I'm not hurt.
gondorian_ranger You should be dead! That spear would have skewered a wild boar.
gondorian_ranger I think there's more to this Hobbit than meets the eye.
gondorian_ranger Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.
party_hobbit To the Bridge of Khazad-dûm!
gondorian_ranger The Fellowship of the Ring
gondorian_ranger What is this new devilry?
gondorian_ranger A Balrog — a demon of the ancient world.
ringwraith This foe is beyond any of you… Run!
denethor Quickly!
party_hobbit Gandalf!
irolas Lead them on, Aragorn! The bridge is near!
irolas Do as I say!
party_hobbit Swords are no more use here!
party_hobbit Gandalf.
ringwraith Merry! Pippin! Hoo-aah!
gondorian_ranger Sam.
gondorian_ranger [holds up his hand] Nobody tosses a dwarf.
wildman Not the beard!
gondorian_ranger Steady. Hold on!
gondorian_ranger Hang on! Lean forward!
gondorian_ranger Come on!
gondorian_ranger Over the bridge! Fly!
denethor You cannot pass!
wildman Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger I am the servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor…
wildman The dark fire will not avail you! Flame of Udûn!
denethor [clenching his teeth] Go back to the Shadow!
wildman You — shall not — pass!
voice_of_the_ring No, no!
party_hobbit Gandalf!
denethor Fly, you fools!
party_hobbit No!
party_hobbit Aragorn!
irolas No!
galadriel The Fellowship of the Ring
irolas Legolas, get them up.
galadriel Give them a moment, for pity's sake!
easterling By nightfall these hills will be swarming with Orcs! We must reach the woods of Lothlórien. Come, Boromir, Legolas, Gimli, get them up.
irolas On your feet Sam. Frodo? Frodo!
irolas Stay close, young Hobbits! They say that a great sorceress lives in these woods, an Elf-witch, of terrible power. All who look upon her, fall under her spell…
gollum Frodo….
irolas …and are never seen again.
barliman_butterbur …Your coming to us… [Frodo halts in his tracks
ringwraith Mister Frodo?
gollum Well, here is one Dwarf she won't ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox!
party_hobbit Oh…
irolas The dwarf breathes so loud, we could have shot him in the dark.
gollum Grrr…
irolas Mae govannen, Legolas Thranduilion. (Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil.)
party_hobbit Govannas vîn gwennen le, Haldir o Lórien. (Our Fellowship stands in your debt, Haldir of Lórien.)
gollum A, Aragorn in Dúnedain istannen le ammen. (Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain, you are known to us.)
party_hobbit Haldir.
party_hobbit So much for the legendary courtesy of the Elves! Speak words we can also understand!
party_hobbit We have not had dealings with the Dwarves since the Dark Days.
party_hobbit And you know what this Dwarf says to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! (I spit upon your grave!)
denethor [grabs Gimli] That was not so courteous.
denethor You bring great evil with you. [looking at Aragorn] You can go no further.
gollum Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven! (We need your protection. The road is fell!)
gollum Merin le telim. (I wish we may come with you.)
voice_of_the_ring Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu lîn! (Please, understand, we need your support!)
celeborn Andelu i ven. (The road is very dangerous.)
corsair_of_umbar Gandalf's death was not in vain… nor would he have you give up hope.
corsair_of_umbar You carry a heavy burden, Frodo… don't carry the weight of the dead.
galadriel You will follow me.
ringwraith Caras Galadhon… the heart of Elvendom on earth. Realm of the Lord Celeborn and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.
galadriel The Fellowship of the Ring
galadriel The Enemy knows you have entered here. What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.
galadriel Eight there are here, yet nine there were, set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf?
corsair_of_umbar For I much desire to speak with him… I can no longer see him from afar.
galadriel Gandalf the Grey did not pass the borders of this land. He has fallen into shadow.
galadriel He was taken by both Shadow and Flame
galadriel Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his whole purpose.
galadriel Do not let the great emptiness of Khazad-dûm fill your heart, Gimli, son of Glóin.
female_elf#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 For the world has grown full of peril. And in all lands, love is now mingled with grief.
other_elves#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 What now becomes of this Fellowship? Without Gandalf, hope is lost.
ringwraith The quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all.
stable_hand Yet hope remains while the company is true.
ringwraith Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Tonight you will sleep in peace.
rohan_refugee_elf Welcome, Frodo of the Shire… one who has seen the Eye!
sam A Olórin i yaresse Mentaner i Numeherui Tírien i Rómenóri
easterling (Olórin who once was Sent by the Lords of the West To guard the Lands of the East)
easterling Melme nóren sina núra ala Eäro
easterling (Our love for this land Is deeper than the deeps Of the sea)
rohan_refugee_elf A lament for Gandalf.
party_hobbit What do they say about him?
denethor I have not the heart to tell you. For me the grief is still too near.
denethor Maiaron i Oiosaila, Manan elye etevanne Nórie i malanelye?
denethor (Wisest of all Maiar, What drove you to leave That which you loved?)
party_hobbit Ilfirin nairelma ullume nucuvalme. Nauva i nauva.
denethor (Yet we will cast all away Rather that submit. What should be shall be.)
voice_of_the_ring I bet they don't mention his fireworks. There should be a verse about them.
galadriel The finest rockets ever seen, They burst in stars of blue and green…
wildman Or after thunder… silver showers…
galadriel Came falling like a… rain of flowers…
galadriel Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.
galadriel Ú-reniathach i amar galen I reniad lín ne môr, nuithannen.
frodo (No more will you wander The green fields of this earth Your journey has ended in darkness.)
galadriel Take some rest. These borders are well protected.
galadriel I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head. She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor. She said to me, 'Even now, there is hope left.' But I cannot see it. It is long since we had any hope.
galadriel My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing. And now our… our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right and I — I would do it. I would see the glory of Gondor restored.
galadriel Have you ever seen it Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver. Its banners caught high in the morning breeze. Have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?
galadriel I have seen the White City, long ago.
wildman One day, our paths will lead us there. And the tower guard shall take up the call
galadriel The Fellowship of the Ring
galadriel Will you look into the mirror?
wildman What will I see?
galadriel [stepping up to the basin] Even the wisest cannot tell. For the mirror… shows many things…
voice_of_the_ring …things that were… things that are… and some things… [She empties the ewer and steps back] that have not yet come to pass.
boromir_ I know what it is you saw, for it is also in my mind. [Her voice echoes in Frodo's head] It is what will come to pass if you should fail. The Fellowship is breaking
boromir_ If you ask it of me, I will give you the One Ring.
saruman You offer it to me freely. I do not deny that my heart has greatly desired this.
shagrat In place of a Dark Lord, you would have a queen!
boromir_ Not dark, but beautiful and terrible as the dawn! Treacherous as the sea!
boromir_ Stronger than the foundations of the earth! All shall love me, and despair!
voice_of_the_ring I pass the test! I will diminish, and go into the West, and remain Galadriel.
corsair_of_umbar I cannot do this alone.
ringwraith You are a Ring bearer, Frodo. To bear a Ring of power is to be alone.
stable_hand This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant, and I am its Keeper. This task was appointed to you, and if you do not find a way, no one will.
corsair_of_umbar Then I know what I must do. It's just… I'm afraid to do it.
corsair_of_umbar Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.
corsair_of_umbar The Fellowship of the Ring
corsair_of_umbar Do you know how the Orcs first came into being? They were Elves once, taken by the dark powers. Tortured and mutilated…
rohan_refugee_elf … a ruined and terrible form of life. And now… perfected
galadriel Whom do you serve?
galadriel Saruman!
galadriel Hunt them down! Do not stop until they are found. You do not know pain, you do not know fear. You will taste man-flesh!
galadriel One of the Halflings carries something of great value. Bring them to me alive, and unspoiled. Kill the others!
easterling The Fellowship of the Ring
galadriel Never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people. May these cloaks help shield you from unfriendly eyes.
gimli Lembas! Elvish Way-bread. One small bite is enough to fill the stomach of a grown man.
irolas How many did you eat?
galadriel Every league you travel south, the danger will increase. Mordor Orcs now hold the eastern shore of the Anduin.
party_hobbit Nor will you find safety on the western bank. Strange creatures bearing the mark of the White Hand have been seen on our borders. Seldom do Orcs journey in the open, under the sun, yet these have done so!
galadriel Le aphadar aen. (You are being tracked.)
galadriel By river you have the chance of outrunning the enemy to the Falls of Rauros.
galadriel Ai! laurië lantar lassi súrien, Yéni úntimë ve rámar aldaron! yéni ve lintë yuldar avánier mi oromardi lisse-miruvóreva Andúnë pella Vardo tellumar nu luini yassen tintilar i eleni…
galadriel (Alas! Like gold fall the leaves in the wind, long years numberless as the wings of the trees! The long years have passed like swift draughts of the sweet mead in lofty halls beyond the West, beneath the vaults of Varda wherein the stars tremble in the song of her voice…)
galadriel My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim, worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.
irolas These are the daggers of the Noldorin. They have already seen service in war.
ringwraith Do not fear, young Peregrin Took. You will find your courage.
irolas And for you, Samwise Gamgee
voice_of_the_ring Thank you, my lady. [He looks sidelong at the blades held by Merry and Pippin, then looks up hopefully.] Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?
party_hobbit And what gift would a Dwarf ask of the Elves?
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Nothing. [a change comes over him; he looks up] Except to look upon the Lady of the Galadhrim one last time, for she is more fair than all the jewels beneath the earth.
party_hobbit Actually, there was one thing — ah, agh, that's quite impossible. Stupid to ask.
denethor I have nothing greater to give, than the gift you already bear. Am meleth dîn. I ant e-guil Arwen Undómiel…pelitha. (For her love, I fear the grace of Arwen Evenstar… will diminish.)
easterling Aníron i e broniatha ar periatham amar hen. Aníron e ciratha a Valannor. (I would have her leave these shores, and be with her people. I would have her take the ship to Valinor.)
wildman That choice is yet before her. You have your own choice to make, Aragorn… to rise above the height of all your fathers since the days of Elendil, or to fall into darkness… with all that is left of your kin.
easterling Namárië. (Farewell.) Nadath nâ i moe cerich. (There is much you have yet to do.)
wildman Dan…ú-'eveditham, Elessar. (We shall not meet again, Elessar.)
easterling Farewell, Frodo Baggins. I give you the light of Eärendil, our most beloved star.
wildman May it be a light for you, in dark places, when all other lights go out.
denethor I have taken my worst wound at this parting, having looked my last upon that which is fairest. Haugh, henceforth I will call nothing fair unless it be her gift to me.
party_hobbit What was it?
denethor I asked her for one hair from her golden head. She gave me three.
denethor The Fellowship of the Ring
party_hobbit Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.
party_hobbit Gollum.
mordor_orc I had hoped we would lose him on the river. But he's too clever a waterman.
voice_of_the_ring And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts it will make the crossing even more dangerous.
party_hobbit Have some food, Mister Frodo.
irolas No, Sam.
irolas You haven't eaten anything all day. You're not sleeping, either. Don't think I haven't noticed. Mister Frodo…
party_hobbit I'm all right.
irolas But you're not! I'm here to help you. I promised Gandalf that I would.
ringwraith You can't help me, Sam… Not this time… Get some sleep.
party_hobbit Minas Tirith is the safer road. You know it. From there we can regroup… strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.
ringwraith There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.
irolas You were quick enough to trust the Elves. Have you so little faith in your own people?
stable_hand Yes, there is weakness. There is frailty. But there is courage also, and honor to be found in Men. But you will not see that. [Aragorn turns away, but Boromir grabs his arm and turns him.] You are afraid! All your life, you have hidden in the shadows!
denethor [turns back suddenly] I will not lead the Ring within a hundred leagues of your city!
denethor Frodo, the Argonath! Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old. My kin.
wildman Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta!' (Out of the Great Sea to Middle-Earth I am come. In this place I will abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world!)
denethor The Fellowship of the Ring
wildman We cross the lake at nightfall. Hide the boats and continue on foot. We approach Mordor from the north.
denethor Oh, yes?! It's just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil? An impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks! And after that, it gets even better!
denethor Festering, stinking marshlands, far as the eye can see!
wildman That is our road. I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf.
denethor Recover my…?! Phrrr…
denethor We should leave now.
denethor No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness.
denethor It is not the eastern shore that worries me. A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near… I can feel it.
wildman No dwarf need recover strength! Pay no heed to that, young Hobbit.
denethor Where's Frodo?
wildman None of us should wander alone, you least of all. So much depends on you. Frodo?
denethor I know why you seek solitude. You suffer. I see it day by day. You sure you do not suffer needlessly? There are other ways, Frodo, other paths that we might take.
denethor I know what you would say. And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning in my heart.
denethor Warning? Against what? We're all afraid, Frodo. But to let that fear drive us to destroy what hope we have… don't you see, that is madness?
party_hobbit There is no other way!
wildman I ask only for the strength to defend my people! [throws the wood to the ground] If you would but lend me the Ring…
party_hobbit Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
party_hobbit You are not yourself!
party_hobbit What chance do you think you have? They will find you! They will take the Ring and you will beg for death before the end!
wildman You Fool!
wildman It is not yours, save by unhappy chance. It could have been mine! [tackles Frodo] It should be mine! Give it to me!
voice_of_the_ring Give it to me!
party_hobbit No!
wildman Give me… Give me the Ring!
party_hobbit Nurgh… ugh!
voice_of_the_ring [looks around desperately] I see your mind. You will take the Ring to Sauron! You will betray us! You'll go to your death and the death of us all! Curse you! Curse you! And all the halflings!
easterling Frodo?… Frodo?… what have I done?… please… Frodo!
twilight_ringwraith [far away] Frodo, I'm sorry! Frodo!
party_hobbit Frodo?
ringwraith [startled] Huh?! It has taken Boromir.
stable_hand [intensely] Where is the Ring?
pippin Frodo!
pippin I swore to protect you!
stable_hand Can you protect me from yourself?!
merry Would you destroy it?
stable_hand Aragorn… Aragorn… Elessar…
pippin I would have gone with you to the end, into the very fires of Mordor.
stable_hand I know. Look after the others, especially Sam. He will not understand.
pippinpippin Go, Frodo. Run. Run!
stable_hand The Fellowship of the Ring
ringwraith Mister Frodo!
party_hobbit Find the Halflings! Yaggh! Find the Halflings!
boromir_ Elendil!
pippin_and_merry#together Aragorn! Go!
party_hobbit Frodo!
denethor Hide here! Quick! Come on!
party_hobbit What's he doin'?
denethor He's leavin'.
party_hobbit Run, Frodo! Go!
denethor Hey! Hey you! Over here!
party_hobbit Hey!
denethor Over here!
denethor [waving his arms] This way!
party_hobbit It's working!
denethor I know its working! Run!
denethor The Horn of Gondor!
party_hobbit Boromir!
voice_of_the_ring Run! Run!
easterling Ahgh!
wildman No!
gondorian_ranger They took the little ones.
easterling Be still.
wildman Frodo! Where is Frodo?
easterling I let Frodo go.
wildman Then you did what I could not. I tried to take the Ring from him.
wildman The Ring is beyond our reach now.
easterling Forgive me. I did not see it. I have failed you all.
wildman Leave it! It is over. The world of men will fall, and all will come to darkness… and my city to ruin.
ringwraith I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you I will not let the White City fall… nor our people fail!
ringwraith Our people? Our people.
party_hobbit I would have followed you my Brother… my Captain… my King!
irolas They will look for his coming from the White Tower. But he will not return.
party_hobbit The Fellowship of the Ring
party_hobbit Frodo!
irolas I wish the Ring had never come to me. I wish none of this had happened.
wildman So do all who live to see such times but that is not for them to decide. All you have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to you.
easterling Frodo, no! Frodo! Mister Frodo!
wildman Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone.
easterling Of course you are, and I'm coming with you!
wildman You can't swim! Sam!

gondorian_ranger You cannot pass!
wildman Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger I am the servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the Flame of Anor…
gondorian_ranger Go back in to the shadow. The dark fire will not avail you! Flame of Udûn!
gondorian_ranger You — shall not — pass!
denethor No! No!
wildman Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger Fly you fools!
wildman No!
wildman Gandalf!
sam What is it Mister Frodo?
wildman Nothing. Just a dream.
sam Can you see the bottom?
wildman No! Don't look down, Sam! Just keep going!
sam Oh! Catch it! Grab it, Mister Frodo!
wildman I think I've found the bottom.
sam Bogs and rope, and goodness knows what. It's not natural. None of it.
wildman What's in this?
sam Nothing. Just a bit of seasonin'. I thought maybe if we was having a roast chicken one night or somethin'.
wildman Roast chicken?
sam You never know.
wildman Sam! My dear Sam.
sam It's very special, that. It's the best salt in all the Shire.
wildman It is special. It's a little bit of home.
wildman We can't leave this for someone to follow us down.
sam Who's gonna follow us down here, Mister Frodo? It's a shame really. Lady Galadriel gave me that. Real Elvish Rope. Well, there's nothing for it. It's one of my knots. Won't come free in a hurry.
wildman Real Elvish rope?
sam Mordor. The one place in Middle-Earth we don't wanna see any closer. It's the one place we are trying to get to. It's just where we can't get.
sam Lets face it Mister Frodo. We're lost. I don't think Gandalf meant for us to come this way.
wildman He didn't mean for a lot of things to happen Sam. But they did.
sam Mister Frodo? It's the Ring, isn't it?
wildman It's getting heavier.
wildman What food have we got left?
sam Well, let me see.
sam Oh yes, lovely. Lembas bread. And look! More Lembas bread.
sam I don't usually hold to foreign food, but this elvish stuff, it's not bad.
wildman Heh, nothing ever dampens you spirits, does it Sam?
sam Those rain clouds might.
sam This looks strangely familiar.
wildman Because we've been here before. We're going in circles.
sam Uh! What's that horrid stink? I wonder if there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you smell it?
wildman Yes, I can smell it.
wildman We're not alone.
voice_of_the_ring The Two Towers
berserker_torchbearer_ You thieves! You thieves… You filthy little thieves! Where is it? Where is it? They stole it from us. My Precious.
berserker_torchbearer_ Curse them! We hates them! It's ours it is… and we wants it!
wildman This is Sting. You've seen it before, haven't you — Gollum!
berserker_torchbearer_ Yes.
wildman Release him, or I'll cut your throat!
berserker_torchbearer_ It burns! It burns us! It freezes! Nasty elves twisted it. Take it off us!
sam Quiet you!
sam It's hopeless! Every orc in Mordor is gonna hear this racket! Let's just tie him up and leave him!
berserker_torchbearer_ No! That would kill us, kill us!
sam It's nothing more than you deserve!
wildman Maybe he does deserve to die. But now that I see him, I do pity him.
berserker_torchbearer_ We'll be nice to them, if they'll be nice to us. Take it off us.
berserker_torchbearer_ We swears to do what you wants. We swears!
wildman There's no promise you can make that I can trust.
berserker_torchbearer_ We swears to serve the Master of the Precious. We will swear on — on the Precious! (gollum gollum)
wildman The Ring is treacherous. It will hold you to your word.
berserker_torchbearer_ Yes… on the Precious… on the Precious.
sam I don't believe you! Get down! Get down!
wildman Sam!
sam He's trying to trick us! We let him go, he'll throttle us in our sleep!
wildman You know the way to Mordor?
berserker_torchbearer_ Yes.
wildman You've been there before?
berserker_torchbearer_ Yes.
wildman You will lead us to the Black Gate.
berserker_torchbearer_ To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate, the masters says. Yes!
berserker_torchbearer_ No! We won't go back. Not there. Not to him. They can't make us. Gollum! Gollum!
berserker_torchbearer_ But we swore to serve the master of the precious!
berserker_torchbearer_ No. Ashes and dust and thirst there is, and pits, pits, pits. And Orcses, thousands of Orcses. And always the Great Eye watching, watching.
sam Hey! Come back now! Come back! There! What did I tell you? He's run off, the old villain. So much for his promises.
berserker_torchbearer_ This way Hobbitses! Follow me!
voice_of_the_ring The Two Towers
urukhai_ Merry! Merry!
diamond_of_long_cleave You're late. Our master grows impatient. He wants the Shire-rats now.
khai I don't take orders from Orc-maggots. Saruman will have his prize. We will deliver them.
urukhai_ Merry! Merry! Wake up! My friend is sick! He needs water. Please!
khai Sick is he? Give him some medicine, boys!
urukhai_ Stop it!
khai Can't take his draught!
urukhai_ Leave him alone!
khai Why? You want some? Huh? Then keep your mouth shut.
urukhai_ Merry.
merry Hello, Pip.
urukhai_ You're hurt.
merry I'm fine. It was just an act.
urukhai_ An act?
merry See? I fooled you too. Don't worry about me, Pippin.
khai What is it? What do you smell?
ugluk Man-flesh.
urukhai_ Aragorn!
khai They've picked up our trail! Let's go!
aragorn Their pace has quickened. They must have caught our scent. Hurry!
legolas Come on, Gimli!
gimli Three day's and night's pursuit… no food, no rest, and no sign of our quarry but what bare rock can tell.
aragorn Not idly do the leaves of Lorien fall.
legolas They may yet be alive.
aragorn Less than a day ahead of us, come!
legolas Come Gimli! We are gaining on them.
gimli I'm wasted on cross-country. We dwarves are natural sprinters. Very dangerous over short distances.
aragorn Rohan. Home of the horse-lords.
aragorn There's something strange at work here. Some evil gives speed to these creatures, sets its will against us.
aragorn Legolas! What do your elf eyes see?
legolas The Uruks turn Northeast. They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
aragorn Saruman.
elf_ The world is changing.
elf_ Who now has the strength to stand against the armies of Isengard and Mordor.
elf_ To stand against the might of Sauron and Saruman, and the union of the Two Towers.
elf_ Together, My Lord Sauron, we shall rule this Middle-Earth.
saruman_ The old world will burn in the fires of industry. Forests will fall. A new order will rise. We will drive the machinery of war with the sword and the spear and the iron fist of the orcs.
elf_ We have only to remove those who oppose us.
elf_ I want them armed and ready to march within two weeks!
eothain But my Lord, there are too many! They cannot all be armed in time, we don't have the means.
elf_ Build a dam, block the stream, work the furnaces night and day.
eothain We don't have enough fuel to feed the fires.
elf_ The Forest of Fangorn lies on our doorstep. Burn it.
eothain Yes!
dunlending#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 We will fight for you.
elf_ Swear it.
dunlending#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 We will die for Saruman.
elf_ The horsemen took your lands. They drove your people into the hills to scratch the living off rocks.
elf_ Take back the lands they stole from you. Burn every village!
saruman_ It will begin in Rohan. Too long have these peasants stood against you. But no more.
mother#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Èothan, Èothan! You take your sister. You'll go faster with just two.
sauron But Papa says Èothan must not ride Garold. She's too big for him!
mother#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Listen to me! You must ride to Edoras and raise the alarm. Do you understand me?!
eothan Yes mama!
freda I don't want to leave! I don't wanna go!
mother#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Listen to me. I will find you there.

rider_1#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Mordor will pay for this.
kissing_hobbit These Orcs are not from Mordor.
rider_2#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 My Lord Èomer. Over here!
kissing_hobbit He's alive!
eowyn Théodred!
eowyn Your son is badly wounded my lord.
kissing_hobbit He was ambushed by orcs. If we don't defend our country, Saruman will take it by force.
grima That is a lie!
grima Saruman the White has ever been our friend and ally.
kissing_hobbit Orcs are roaming freely across our lands. Unchecked, unchallenged, killing at will.
kissing_hobbit Orcs bearing the white hand of Saruman.
grima Why do you lay these troubles on an already troubled mind?
grima Can you not see? Your uncle is wearied by your malcontent, your warmongering.
kissing_hobbit Warmongering?!
kissing_hobbit How long is it since Saruman bought you? What was the promised price, Gríma? When all the men are dead you would take a share of the treasure?
kissing_hobbit Too long have you watched my sister. Too long have you haunted her steps.
grima You see much, Èomer son of Èomund. Too much.
grima You are banished forthwith from the kingdom of Rohan, and all its domains, under pain of death.
kissing_hobbit You have no authority here. Your orders mean nothing.
grima This order does not come from me. It comes from the king.
grima He signed it this morning.
kissing_hobbit Argh!
voice_of_the_ring The Two Towers
gimli Keep breathing, that's the key! Breathe! Hooh!
legolas They run as if the very whips of their masters were behind them.
elanor_gamgee We ain't goin' no further 'till we've had a breather!
ugluk Get a fire going!
urukhai_ Merry! Merry!
merry I think we might have made a mistake, leaving the Shire, Pippin.
urukhai_ What's making that noise?
merry It's the trees.
urukhai_ What?
merry You remember the Old Forest? On the borders of Buckland? Folks used to say that there was something in the water that made the trees grow tall, and come alive.
urukhai_ Alive?
merry Trees that could whisper, talk to each other. Even move.
elanor_gamgee I'm starving. We ain't had nothing but maggoty bread for three stinking days!
snaga Yeah! Why can't we have some meat?
snaga What about them? They're fresh!
ugluk They are not for eating!
grishnakh What about their legs? They don't need those. Ooh! They look tasty!
ugluk Get back, scum! The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive and unspoiled.
diamond_of_long_cleave Alive? Why alive? Do they give good sport?
ugluk They have something. An Elvish weapon. The master wants it for the war.
urukhai_ They think we have the Ring.
merry Shhh! As soon as they find out we don't, we're dead.
snaga Just a mouthful. A bit off the flank.
ugluk Looks like meat's back on the menu, boys!
merry Pippin, let's go!
grishnakh Go on, call for help. Squeal! No one's gonna save you now!
merry Pippin!
urukhai_ Argh!

legolas A red sun rises. Blood has been spilt this night.
aragorn Riders of Rohan! What news from the Mark?
kissing_hobbit What business does an elf, a man and a dwarf have in the Riddermark?
eomer Speak quickly!
gimli Give me your name, horsemaster, and I shall give you mine.
kissing_hobbit I would cut off your head — dwarf — if it stood but a little higher from the ground.
legolas You would die before your stroke fell!
aragorn I'm Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
aragorn This is Gimli, son of Glóin, and Legolas, from the Woodland realm.
aragorn We are friends of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
kissing_hobbit Théoden no longer recognizes friend from foe.
kissing_hobbit Not even his own kin.
kissing_hobbit Saruman has poisoned the mind of the king and claimed lordship over this land. My company are those loyal to Rohan. And for that, we are banished.
kissing_hobbit The White Wizard is cunning. He walks here and there they say, as an old man, hooded and cloaked.
kissing_hobbit And everywhere his spies slip past our nets.
aragorn We are no spies. We track a band of Uruk-hai westward across the plains. They have taken two of our friends captive.
kissing_hobbit The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered them during the night.
gimli But there were two hobbits, did you see two hobbits with them?
aragorn They would be small, only children to your eyes.
kissing_hobbit We left none alive.
kissing_hobbit We piled the carcasses and burned them. (Points to smoke in the distance.)
gimli Dead?
kissing_hobbit (Nods.) I am sorry.
kissing_hobbit Hasufel! Arod!
kissing_hobbit May these horses bear you to better fortune than the former masters. [nods] Farewell.
kissing_hobbit Look for your friends, but do not trust the hope. It has forsaken these lands. We ride north!

gimli It's one of their little belts.
legolas Hiro hyn hîdh ab wanath. (May they find peace in death.)
gimli We failed them.
aragorn A Hobbit lay here, and the other.
aragorn They crawled.
aragorn Their hands were bound.
aragorn Their bonds were cut.
aragorn They ran over here… and were followed.
merry The belt! Run!
aragorn The tracks lead away from the battle! Into… Fangorn Forest.
gimli Fangorn! What madness drove them in there?
urukhai_ Did we lose him? I think we lost him.
grishnakh I'm gonna rip off your filthy little heads! Come here!
merry Trees! Climb a tree!
merry He's gone.
urukhai_ Merry!
urukhai_ Argh!
grishnakh Let's put a maggot hole in your belly.
urukhai_ Run Merry!
tree#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Little orcs! Búrarum.
urukhai_ It's talking Merry. The tree is talking.
tree#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Tree! I am no tree! I am an Ent.
merry Treeherder! A shepherd of the forest.
urukhai_ Don't talk to it Merry. Don't encourage it.
tree#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Treebeard some call me.
urukhai_ And whose side are you on?
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Side? I am on nobody's side. Because nobody is on my side, little orc.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
merry We are not orcs. We are Hobbits!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit before. Sounds like orc mischief to me.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 They come with fire, they come with axes. Biting, breaking, hacking, burning. Destroyers and usurpers. Curse them!
merry No! You don't understand. We are Hobbits, halflings. Shirefolk!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Maybe you are, and maybe you aren't. The White Wizard will know.
urukhai_ White Wizard?
merry Saruman!
voice_of_the_ring The Two Towers
berserker_torchbearer_ See, see, we've led you out! Hurry hobbitses, hurry. Very lucky we find you.
berserker_torchbearer_ Nice Hobbit.
sam Whoa! It's a bog! He's led us into a swamp!
berserker_torchbearer_ Swamp, yes yes. Come master. We will take you on safe paths, through the mist. Come Hobbits come! We move quickly.
berserker_torchbearer_ I found it. I did. The way through the marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't know it. They go round for miles and miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be.
sam I hate this place. It's too quiet. There's been no sight nor sound of a bird for two days.
berserker_torchbearer_ No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable birdses. We are famished! Yes! Famished we are, precious.
wildman Here.
berserker_torchbearer_ What does it eats? Is it tasty?
berserker_torchbearer_ Aggh! It tries to chokes us! We can't eats Hobbit food! We must starve!
sam Well starve then, and good riddance!
berserker_torchbearer_ Oh! Cruel Hobbit! It does not care if we be hungry. It does not care if we should die. Not like Master. Master cares. Master knows.
gollum Yes, precious. Once it takes hold of us it never lets go.
wildman Don't touch me.
sam There are dead things! Dead faces in the water!
berserker_torchbearer_ All dead. All rotten. Elves and men and orcses. A great battle long ago.
berserker_torchbearer_ The Dead Marshes. Yes, yes! That is their name. This way. don't follow the lights.
sam Ohh!
berserker_torchbearer_ Careful now! Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones, and light little candles of their own.
sam Frodo!
wildman Gollum?
berserker_torchbearer_ Don't follow the lights!
sam Frodo! are you all right?
berserker_torchbearer_ So bright, so beautiful.
berserker_torchbearer_ Our Precious.
wildman What did you say?
berserker_torchbearer_ Master should be resting. Master needs to keep up his strength.
wildman Who are you?
berserker_torchbearer_ Mustn't ask us, not its business. (gollum gollum)
wildman Gandalf told me you were one of the River Folk.
berserker_torchbearer_ Cold be heart and hand and bone. And called be travelers far from home.
wildman He said your life was a sad story.
berserker_torchbearer_ They do not see what lies ahead when sun has failed and moon is dead.
wildman You were not so different from a Hobbit once were you? — Sméagol.
berserker_torchbearer_ What did you call me?
wildman That was your name once, wasn't it? A long time ago.
berserker_torchbearer_ My — My name… Smé — Sméagol.
sam Black Riders!
berserker_torchbearer_ Hide! Hide!
wildman Argh!
wildman Argh!
sam C'mon Frodo, C'mon!
berserker_torchbearer_ They will see us! They will see us!
sam I thought they were dead?!
berserker_torchbearer_ Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
berserker_torchbearer_ Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
berserker_torchbearer_ They are calling for It. They are calling for the Precious!
sam It's all right.
berserker_torchbearer_ Hurry Hobbits. The Black Gate is very close.
voice_of_the_ring The Two Towers
gimli Orc blood!
aragorn These are strange tracks.
gimli The air is so close here.
legolas This forest is old. Very old. Full of memory… and anger.
legolas The trees are speaking to each other.
aragorn Gimli!
gimli Huh?
aragorn Lower your axe.
gimli Oh!
legolas They have feelings, my friend. The Elves began it
gimli Talking trees. What do trees have to talk about, hmm? Except the consistency of squirrel droppings.
legolas Aragorn, nad no ennas! (Something is out there!)
aragorn Man cenich? (What do you see?)
legolas The White Wizard approaches.
aragorn Do not let him speak. He will put a spell on us!
aragorn We must be quick.
gimli Argh!
wizard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 You are tracking the footsteps of two young Hobbits.
aragorn Where are they?
wizard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 They passed this way, the day before yesterday. They met someone they did not expect. Does that comfort you?
aragorn Who are you? Show yourself!
aragorn It cannot be!
legolas Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman.
gondorian_ranger I am Saruman. Or rather Saruman as he should have been.
aragorn You fell!
gondorian_ranger Through fire. And water.
gondorian_ranger From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, I fought him, the Balrog of Morgoth.
gondorian_ranger Until at last, I threw down my enemy and smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
gondorian_ranger Darkness took me. And I strayed out of thought and time.
gondorian_ranger Stars wheeled overhead, and every day was as long as the life age of the earth.
gondorian_ranger But it was not the end. I felt light in me again.
gondorian_ranger I've been sent back until my task is done.
aragorn Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger Gandalf? Oh yes. That's what they used to call me. Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.
gimli Gandalf!
gondorian_ranger I am Gandalf the White.
gondorian_ranger And I come back to you now, at the turn of the tide.
gondorian_ranger One stage of your journey is over, another begins. War has come to Rohan. We must ride to Edoras with all speed.
gimli Edoras? That is no short distance!
aragorn We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill with the king.
gondorian_ranger Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
gimli Then we have run all this way for nothing? Are we to leave those poor hobbits here in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested…
gimli I mean charming, quite charming forest.
gondorian_ranger It was more than mere chance that brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A great power has been sleeping here for many long years. The coming of Merry and Pippin will be like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.
aragorn In one thing you have not changed, dear friend.
gondorian_ranger Hmm?
aragorn You still speak in riddles.
gondorian_ranger A thing is about to happen here that has not happened since the Elder Days. The Ents are going to wake up and find that they are strong.
gimli So stop your fretting Master Dwarf. Merry and Pippin are quite safe. In fact, they are far safer than you are about to be.
gondorian_ranger This new Gandalf's more grumpy than the old one.
gimli That is one of the Mearas, unless my eyes are cheated by some spell.
legolas Shadowfax.
gondorian_ranger He's the lord of all horses, and has been my friend through many dangers.
gondorian_ranger The Two Towers
voice_of_the_ring Oh rowan mine I saw you shine upon a summer's day. Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Such a beautiful verse.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Is it much further?
merry Bru-ra-hroom. Don't be hasty. You might call it far perhaps. My home lies deep in the forest near the roots of the mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep you safe and, safe is where I'll keep you. I believe you will enjoy this next one. It is one of my own compositions. Right, ahem.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves and the dreams of trees unfold When woodland halls are green and cool, and the wind is in the west Come back to me. Come back to me, And say my land is best.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Oh, oh. Sleep little Shirelings. Heed no nightly noise. Sleep 'til morning light.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 I have business in the forest. There are many to call. Many that must come. The shadow lies on Fangorn. The withering of all woods is drawing near. The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now. Too few of us left to manage them.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 The veiling shadow that glowers in the East takes shape. Sauron will suffer no rival. From the summit of Barad-Dûr his Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear. Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has reached him
gondorian_ranger He will use his puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan. War is coming. Rohan must defend itself and therein lies our first challenge, for Rohan is weak and ready to fall. The King's mind is enslaved. It's an old device of Saruman's. His hold over King Théoden is now very strong. Sauron and Saruman are tightening the noose.
gondorian_ranger But for all their cunning, we have one advantage. The Ring remains hidden, and that we should seek to destroy it has not yet entered their darkest dreams. And so the weapon of the enemy is moving towards Mordor in the hands of a hobbit. Each day brings it closer to the fires of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo. Everything depends upon speed and the secrecy of his quest.
gondorian_ranger Do not regret your decision to leave him. Frodo must finish this task alone.
gandalf He is not alone. Sam went with him.
aragorn Did he? Did he indeed? Good. Yes, very good.
gondorian_ranger The Black Gate of Mordor!
berserker_torchbearer_ My old Gaffer would have a thing or two to say if he saw this.
sam Master says show him the way into Mordor, so good Sméagol does, master says so.
berserker_torchbearer_ I did.
wildman That's it then. We cannot get past them.
sam Za dashu snaku Zigur, Durbgu nazgshu, Durbgu dashshu! (Hail, Sauron, Lord of the Ring, Lord of the Earth!)
mrs_bracegirdle_ Look! The gate, it's opening!
sam I can see a way down.
sam Sam! No!
wildman Argh!
sam Master!
berserker_torchbearer_ I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.
wildman I know, Mister Frodo. I doubt even these Elvish cloaks will help us in there.
sam Now!
wildman No! No! No Master! They'd catch you! They'd catch you. Don't take it to Him.
berserker_torchbearer_ He wants the Precious.
berserker_torchbearer_ Always he's looking for it. And the Precious is wanting to go back to him.
berserker_torchbearer_ But we mustn't let Him have it.
berserker_torchbearer_ No! There is another way. More secret, and dark way.
berserker_torchbearer_ Why haven't you spoke of this before?!
sam Because Master did not ask!
berserker_torchbearer_ He's up to something.
sam Are you saying that there is another way to Mordor?
wildman Yes. There's a path, and some stairs and then a tunnel.
berserker_torchbearer_ He's led us this far Sam.
wildman Mister Frodo, no!
sam He's been true to his word.
wildman No!
sam Lead the way Sméagol.
wildman Good Sméagol always helps.
wildman The Two Towers
voice_of_the_ring Hello? Treebeard? Where has he gone?
merry I had the loveliest dream last night. There was this large barrel, full of pipe-weed. And we smoked all of it. And then you were sick. I'd give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
urukhai_ Did you hear that? There it is again. Something's not right here. Not right at all.
merry You just said something… treeish.
merry No I didn't. I was just stretching.
urukhai_ You're taller.
merry Who?
urukhai_ You!
merry Than what?
urukhai_ Than me!
merry I've always been taller than you.
urukhai_ Pippin, everyone knows I'm the tall one. You're the short one.
merry Please, Merry. You're what, three-foot-six? At the most? Whereas me, I'm pushing three-seven, three-eight.
urukhai_ Three-foot-eight? You did something.
merry Merry, don't! Don't drink it. Merry! Treebeard said that you shouldn't have any.
urukhai_ I want some!
merry It could be dangerous! Give it back! Merry!
urukhai_ What's happening?
urukhai_ Gah! It's got my leg!
merry Merry!
urukhai_ Help!
urukhai_ Away with you. You should not be waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink water. Go to sleep. Away with you.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Come, the forest is waking up. It isn't safe.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 The trees have grown wild and dangerous. Anger festers in their hearts. Black are their thoughts. Strong is their hate. They will harm you if they can. There are too few of us now, too few of us Ents left to manage them.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Why are there so few of you when you have lived so long? Are there Ent children?
urukhai_ Bru-ha-hroom. There have been no Entings for a terrible long count of years.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Why is that?
merry We lost the Entwives.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Oh, I'm sorry. How did they die?
urukhai_ Die, no. We lost them. And now we cannot find them. I don't suppose you've seen Entwives in the Shire?
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Can't say that I have. You Pip?
merry What do they look like?
urukhai_ I don't remember, now.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan, whose mind is overthrown. Saruman's hold over King Théoden is now very strong.
gondorian_ranger My lord, you son, he is dead. My lord? Uncle? Will you not go to him? Will you do nothing.
eowyn Be careful what you say. Do not look for welcome here.
gondorian_ranger Oh he, he must have died sometime in the night. What a tragedy for the king to lose his only son and heir.
grima I understand his passing is hard to accept, especially now that your brother has deserted you.
grima Leave me alone snake!
eowyn Oh but you are alone!
grima Who knows what you have spoken to the darkness. In bitter watches of the night. When all your life seems to shrink. The walls of your bower closing in about you. A hatch to trammel some wild thing.
grima So fair, so cold, like a morning pale spring still clinging to winter's chill.
grima Your words are poison.
eowyn You'll find more cheer in a graveyard.
gimli The Two Towers
voice_of_the_ring Ah.
gondorian_ranger I cannot allow you before Théoden king so armed, Gandalf Grayhame. By order of… Gríma Wormtongue.
haradrim_warrior_ Your staff.
haradrim_warrior_ Eh? Oh. No, you would not part an old man from his walking stick?
gondorian_ranger My lord. Gandalf the Grey is coming. He is a herald of woe.
grima The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Théoden King.
gondorian_ranger He is not welcome.
grima Why should I welcome you, Gandalf Stormcrow?
ugluk A just question my liege.
grima Late is the hour in which this conjurer chooses to appear. Lathspell I name him. Ill news is in ill guest.
grima Be silent! Keep your forked tongue behind you teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a witless worm!
gondorian_ranger His staff! I told you to take the wizard's staff!
grima Théoden, Son of Théngel. Too long have you sat in the shadows.
gondorian_ranger I would stay still if I were you.
gimli Harken to me! I release you from the spell.
gondorian_ranger (Laughs.) You have no power here Gandalf the Grey.
ugluk I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is drawn from a wound.
gondorian_ranger Aah!
ugluk Wait.
aragorn If I go — Théoden dies.
theoden You did not kill me. You will not kill him.
gondorian_ranger Rohan is mine!
theoden Be gone!
gondorian_ranger I know your face. Èowyn — Èowyn.
ugluk Gandalf?
ugluk Breathe the free air again, my friend.
gondorian_ranger Dark have been my dreams of late.
ugluk Your fingers would remember their old strength better — if they grasped your sword.
gondorian_ranger The Two Towers
voice_of_the_ring Argh! I've only ever served you my lord.
grima Your leechcraft would have had me crawling on all fours like a beast!
ugluk Send me not from your side!
grima No my lord! No my lord. Let him go.
aragorn Enough blood has been spilt on his account.
aragorn Get out of my way!
grima Hail, Théoden, King!
aragorn Where is Théodred? Where is my son?
ugluk Bealocwealm hafað fréone frecan forth onsended giedd sculon singan gléomenn sorgiende
eowyn (An evil death has set forth the noble warrior A song shall sing sorrowing minstrels)
ugluk on Meduselde þæt he ma no wære, Þæt he ma nowere is, þurh niedig rest.
ugluk (in Meduseld that he is no more, That he is nowhere anymore, for his necessary rest.)
gondorian_ranger And mægen deorost. Bealo…
ugluk (And that he is the dearest kinsman. Killing took him…)
gondorian_ranger Simbelmynë, ever has it grown on the tombs of my forebears. Now it shall cover the grave of my son.
gondorian_ranger Alas, that these evil days should be mine. The young perish and the old linger. That I should live to see the last days of my house.
eowyn Théodred's death was not of your making.
sauron No parent should have to bury their child.
eowyn He was strong in life. His spirit will find its way to the halls of your fathers.
gondorian_ranger Westu hál. Ferðu, Théodred, Ferðu. (Be-thou well. Go-thou, Théodred, go-thou.)
gondorian_ranger They had no warning. They were unarmed. Now the Wildmen are moving through westfold, burning as they go, every rick, cot and tree.
aragorn Where's mama?
ugluk Hush.
ugluk This is but a taste of the terror that Saruman will unleash. All the more potent for he is driven mad by the fear of Sauron.
aragorn Ride out and meet him head on. Draw him away from your women and children. You must fight.
ugluk You have two thousand good men riding north as we speak. Èomer is loyal to you. His men will return and fight for their king.
gimli They will be three hundred leagues from here by now! Èomer cannot help us.
gondorian_ranger I know what is that you want of me. But I would not bring further death to my people. I will not risk open war.
voice_of_the_ring Open war is upon you, whether would risk it or not.
haradrim_warrior_ When last I looked, Théoden, not Aragorn, was king of Rohan.
gimli Burp!
aragorn Then what is the king's decision?
gondorian_ranger The Two Towers
gondorian_ranger By order of the King, the city must empty. We make for the refuge of Helm's Deep. Do not burden yourself with treasures. Take only what provisions you need.
gondorian_ranger Helm's Deep! They flee to the mountains when they should stand and fight. Who will defend them if not their king?
aragorn He is only doing what he thinks is best for his people. Helm's Deep has saved them in the past.
gondorian_ranger There is no way out than that of ravine. Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks he is leading them to safety, but what he'll get is a massacre.
gondorian_ranger Théoden has a strong hold but I fear for him. I fear for the survival of Rohan.
gondorian_ranger He will need you before the end, Aragorn. The people of Rohan will need you. The defenses have to hold.
aragorn They will hold.
rohan_man The Grey Pilgrim. That is what they used to call me. Three hundred lives of men I've walked this earth and now, I have no time.
aragorn Good luck. My search will not be in vain.
aragorn Look to my coming, at first light, on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.
eowyn Go.
aragorn That horse is half mad, my lord. There's nothing you can do. Leave him.
aragorn Fæste, stille nú, fæste, stille nú. Lac is drefed, gefrægon. (Fast, quiet now, fast, quiet now. A battle is stirred up, they heard.)
aragorn Hwæt nemnað ðe? (What is your name?)
eowyn His name is Brego. He was my cousin's horse.
aragorn Brego? Ðin nama is cynglic. (Brego? Your name is kingly.)
aragorn Man le trasta, Brego? (What troubles you, Brego?)
elf_ Man cenich? (What did you see?)
grima I've heard of the magic of Elves, but I did not look for it in a Ranger from the North. You speak as one of their own.
elf_ I was raised in Rivendell, for a time.
grimagrima Turn this fellow free. He has seen enough of war.
elf_ Gandalf the White. Gandalf the fool! Does he seek to humble me with his newfound piety?
elf_ There were three who followed the wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.
ugluk (Sniffs.) You stink of horse. The man, was he from Gondor?
ugluk No, from the North. One of the Dúnedain Rangers I thought he was.
ugluk His cloth was spoor. And yet he bore a strange ring. Two serpents with emerald eyes. One devouring, the other crowned with golden flowers.
aragorn The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame thinks he's found Isildur's heir, the lost King of Gondor. He is a fool. The line was broken years ago.
eowyn It matters not. The world of Men shall fall. It will begin at Edoras.
eowyn I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse.
aragorn This is not a defeat. We will return.
eowyn We will return.
aragorn You have some skill with a blade.
grima Women of this country learned long ago that those without swords may still die upon them.
grimagrima I fear neither death nor pain.
elf_ What do you fear my lady?
voice_of_the_ring A cage. To stay behind bars until use and old age accept them. And all chance of valor has gone beyond recall or desire.
sam You are a daughter of kings. A shieldmaiden of Rohan. I do not think that will be your fate.
wildman Théoden will not stay at Edoras. It is vulnerable, he knows this. He will expect an attack on the city. They will flee to Helm's Deep, the great fortress of Rohan.
sam It is a dangerous road, take through the mountains. It will be slow.
wildmansam They will have women and children with them.
wildman Send out your Warg riders.
sam The Two Towers
wildman Hey stinker! Don't go getting too far ahead!
sam Why do you do that?
frodo What?
wildman Call him names? Run him down all the time.
sam Because. Because that's what he is Mister Frodo. There's naught left in him but lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. It's all he cares about.
wildman You have no idea what it did to him. What is still doing to him. I want to help him Sam.
sam Why?
berserker_torchbearer_ Because I have to believe he can come back.
berserker_torchbearer_ You cannot save him, Mister Frodo.
gollum What do you know about it? Nothing!
berserker_torchbearer_ I'm sorry Sam. I don't know why I said that.
gollum I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your eyes off it. I've seen you. You're not eating. You barely sleep. It's taking a hold of you Mister Frodo. You have to fight it.
berserker_torchbearer_ I know what I must to do Sam. The Ring was entrusted to me. It's my task! Mine! My own!
gollum Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know who you sound like?
berserker_torchbearer_ We wants it, we needs it. Must have the Precious.
gollum They stole it from us. Sneaky little hobbitses. Wicked, tricksy, false!
berserker_torchbearer_ No! No! Master!
gollum Yes. Precious first. They will cheat you, hurt you, lie!
berserker_torchbearer_ Master's my friend.
gollum You don't have any friends. Nobody likes you.
berserker_torchbearer_ Not listening. Not listening.
gollum You're a liar, and a thief.
berserker_torchbearer_ No.
gollum Murderer!
berserker_torchbearer_ Go away.
gollum Go away?! (Laughs.)
berserker_torchbearer_ I hate you, I hate you!
gollum Where would you be without me? (gollum gollum). I saved us. It was me. We survived because of me!
berserker_torchbearer_ Not anymore.
gollum What did you say?
gollum Master looks after us now. We don't need you.
voice_of_the_ring What?
gollum Leave now and never come back.
gollum No!
sam Leave now and never come back!
gollum Argh!
sam Leave now and never come back!
sam We told him to go away! And away he goes Precious. Gone, gone, gone, Sméagol is free!
gollum The Two Towers
sam Look! Look! See what Sméagol finds! (Laughs.)
gollum They are young! They are tender and nice. Yes they are! Eat them. Eat them.
sam Make him sick you will, behaving like that. There's only one way to eat a brace of coneys.
gollum Argh! What's he doing! Stupid fat hobbit. You ruins it!
gollum What's to ruin? There's hardly any meat on them.
sam What we need is a few good taters.
sam What's taters? Precious, what's taters? Huh?
sam Po-ta-toes! Boil them, mash them, stick them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.
gollum Phooh!
sam Even you couldn't say no to that.
gollum Oh yes we could! Spoiling nice fish!
wildman Give it to us raw — and wriggling! You keep nasty chips!
sam You're hopeless.
wildman Mister Frodo?
wildman Who are they?
sam Wicked men; servants of Sauron. They are called to Mordor. The Dark One is gathering all armies to him. It won't be long now. It will soon be ready.
faramir Ready to do what?
wildman To make His war. The last war that will cover all the world in shadow.
faramir We've got to keep moving. C'mon Sam.
faramir Mister Frodo! Look! It's an Oliphant! No one at home will believe this.
faramir Sméagol?
voice_of_the_ring We've lingered here for too long. C'mon Sam!
gimli Ah! Wait! We're innocent travelers!
aragorn There are no travelers in this land, only servants of the Dark Tower.
gimli The enemy?
eowyn His sense of duty was no less than yours, I deem. You wonder what his name is, where he came from, and if he was really evil at heart. What lies or threats led him on this long march from home. If he would not rather have stayed there in peace.
gimli War will make corpses of us all. Bind their hands.
gimli The Two Towers
ugluk It's true you don't see many dwarf women. And in fact, they are so alike in voice and appearance, they are often mistaken for dwarf men.
ugluk It's the beards.
ugluk And this in turn has given rise to the belief that there are no dwarf women. And the dwarves just spring out of holes in the ground!
eowyn (Laughs.)
gimli (Laughs.) Which is of course ridiculous. Whoa!
eowyn It's all right! It's all right. Nobody panic. That was deliberate. It was deliberate.
aragorn I have not seen my niece smile in a long time.
aragorn She was a girl when they brought her father back dead. Cut down by Orcs.
eowyn She watched her mother succumb to grief. And she was left alone to tend her king in growing fear. Doomed to wait upon an old man who should have loved her as a father.
aragorn Gimli?
eowyn No, I couldn't. I really couldn't.
aragorn I made some stew. It isn't much, but it's hot.
eowyn Thank you.
aragorn Mmm. It's good.
eowyn Really?
aragorn Mmm.
eowyn My Uncle told me a strange thing. He said that you rode to war with Thengel, my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.
arwen King Théoden has a good memory. He was only a small child at the time.
aragorn Then you must be at least sixty. Seventy? But you cannot be eighty!
saruman Eighty-seven.
saruman You are one of the Dúnedain. A descendant of Númenor, blessed with long life. It was said that your race had passed into legend.
aragorn There are few of us left. The Northern Kingdom was destroyed long ago.
saruman I'm sorry. Please eat!
aragorn The light of the Evenstar does not wax and wane. It is mine to give to whom I will. Like my heart. Go to sleep.
saruman I am asleep. This is a dream.
aragorn Then it is a good dream. Sleep.
saruman Sleep.
eowyn Minlû pedich nin, i aur hen telitha. (You told me once, this day would come.)
goblin_ Ú i vethed. Nâ i onnad. Boe bedich go Frodo. Han bâd lîn. (This is not the end. It is the beginning. You must go with Frodo. That is your path.)
aragorn Dolen i vâd o nin. (My path is hidden from me.)
goblin_ Si peliannen i vâd na dail lîn. Si boe ú-dhannathach. (It is already laid before your feet, you cannot falter now.)
aragorn Arwen.
goblin_ Ae ú-esteliach nad… estelio han. Estelio ammen. (If you trust nothing else… trust this. Trust us.)
saruman Where is she? The woman who gave you that jewel?
aragorn Our time here is ending. Arwen's time is ending. Let her go. Let her take the ship into the West. Let her bear away her love for you to the undying lands, there to be ever green.
saruman But never more than a memory.
aragorn I will not leave my daughter here to die.
saruman She stays because she still has hope.
aragorn She stays for you! She belongs with her people.
saruman Nach gwannatha sin? Ma nathach hi gwannathach or minuial archened? {Is this how you would take your leave? Did you think you could slip away at first light — unnoticed?)
aragorn Ú-ethelithon. (I will not be coming back.)
saruman Estelio guru lîn ne dagor. Ethelithach. (You underestimate your skill in battle. You will come back.)
aragorn Ú-bedin o gurth ne dagor. (It is not of death in battle that I speak.)
saruman O man pedich? (What do you speak of?)
eowyn Edra le men, men na guil edwen, haer o auth a nîr a naeth. (You have a chance for another life, away from war, grief, despair.)
aragorn Why are you saying this?
voice_of_the_ring I am mortal. You are elfkind. It was a dream Arwen, nothing more.
wormtongue I don't believe you.
haradrim_warrior_ This belongs to you.
legolas It was a gift. Keep it.
ugluk My lord?
aragorn She is sailing to the undying lands, with all that is left of her kin.
ugluk The Two Towers
gimli What is it? Háma?
ugluk I'm not sure.
eowyn A scout!
ugluk What is it? What do you see?
ugluk Wargs! We are under attack!
gimli All riders to the head of the column!
eowyn C'mon get me up here, I'm a fighter. Argh!
gimli You must lead the people to Helm's Deep and make haste.
gimli I can fight!
gimli No! You must do this — for me.
legolas Follow me! Argh!
gimli Forward, forward, march forward.
gimli Make for the lower ground. Stick together!
eothain Bring your pretty face to my axe!
legolas Argh! That one counts as mine!
ugluk Argh! Stinking creature. Argh!
ugluk Aragorn!
ugluk Aragorn?
voice_of_the_ring Tell me what happened and I will ease your passing!
villagers#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 He's… (cough)… dead. (Laughs). He took a little tumble off the cliff.
sauron You lie!
mother#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Get the wounded on horses. The wolves of Isengard will return.
eowyn Leave the dead.
legolas Come.
eowyn The Two Towers
hama Helm's Deep!
eowyn Mama!
ugluk Freda! Freda!
gimli Where is the rest?
eowyn This is all we could save, my lady.
gimli Take it to the caves.
ugluk Make way for the king! Make way for Théoden. Make way for the King!
hama So few. So few of you have returned.
ugluk Our people are safe. We have paid for it with many lives.
grima My lady…
grima Lord Aragorn, where is he?
elf_ He fell…
grima Draw all our forces behind the wall. Bar the gate, and set a watch on the surround.
elf_ What of those who cannot fight my lord? The women and children?
grima Get them into the caves. Saruman's arm would have grown long indeed if he thinks he can reach us here.
elf_ Helm's Deep has but one weakness. It's outer wall is solid rock for except for a small culvert in space, which is little more than a drain.
elf_ How? How can fire undo stone? What kind of device can break down a wall?
elf_ If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will fall.
elf_ Even if it is breached, it would take a number beyond reckoning — thousands — to storm the keep.
urukhai_ Tens of thousands.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 But my lord there is no such force.
merry A new power is rising. Its victory is at hand.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 This night, the land will be stained with the blood of Rohan! March to Helm's Deep! Leave none alive!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 To war!
urukhai_ There will be no dawn for Men.
merry Look! There's smoke to the south!
voice_of_the_ring There is always smoke rising up from Isengard these days.
saruman Isengard?
goblin_ There was a time, when Saruman would walk in my woods, but now, he has a mind of metal and wheels.
saruman He no longer cares for growing things.
goblin_ What is it?
saruman It's Saruman's army! The war has started.
goblin_ The Two Towers
goblin_ May the grace of the Valar protect you.
goblin_ Arwen. Tollen i lû. I chair gwannar na Valannor. Si bado, no círar. (Arwen. It is time. The ships are leaving for Valinor. Go now, before it is too late.)
goblin_ I've made my choice.
goblin_ He is not coming back. Why do you linger when there is no hope?
goblin_ There is still hope.
goblin_ If Aragorn survives this war, You will still be parted.
goblin_ If Sauron is defeated, and Aragorn made king and all that you hoped for comes true… you will still have to taste the bitterness of mortality.
saruman Whether by the sword or the slow decay of time, Aragorn will die. And there will be no comfort for you. No comfort to ease the pain of his passing.
hero_orcs He will come to death. An image of the splendor of the kings of men in glory, undimmed before the breaking of the world.
hero_orcs But you, my daughter, you will linger on in darkness and in doubt. As night falling winter has come without a star.
hero_orcs Here you will dwell, bound to you grief, under the fading trees, until all the world has changed and the long years of your life are utterly spent.
hero_orcs Arwen… there is nothing for you here, only death.
hero_orcs Ah im, ú erin veleth lîn? (Do I not also have your love?)
galadriel Gerich veleth nîn, ada. (You have my love, father.)
hero_orcs I amar prestar aen. Han mathon ne nen, han mathon ne chae a han noston ned wilith. (The world is changed. I can feel it in the water, I can feel it in the earth, I can smell it in the air.)
hero_orcs The power of the enemy is growing. Sauron will use his puppet Saruman to destroy the people of Rohan.
hero_orcs Isengard has been unleashed.
hero_orcs The Eye of Sauron now turns to Gondor. The last free kingdom of men.
voice_of_the_ring His war on this country will come swiftly. He senses the Ring is close. The strength of the Ringbearer is failing. In his heart, Frodo begins to understand. The quest will claim his life.
faramir You know this. You have foreseen it. It is the risk we all took.
isengard_orc_ In the gathering dark, the will of the Ring grows strong. It works hard now to find its way back into the hands of men. Men, who are so easily seduced by its power.
faramir The young captain of Gondor has but to extend his hand to take the Ring for his own and the world will fall. He is close now, so close to achieving his goal.
isengard_orc_ For Sauron will have dominion over all life on this Earth, even until the ending of the world.
faramir The time of the elves is over. Do we leave Middle-Earth to this fate? Do we let them stand alone?
isengard_orc_ The Two Towers
faramir What news?
faramir Our scouts report Saruman has attacked Rohan. Théoden's people have fled to Helm's Deep. But we must look to our own borders. Faramir, orcs are on the move. Sauron is marshalling an army. Easterlings and Southrons are passing through the Black Gate.
sam How many?
faramir Some thousands. More come every day.
faramir Who's covering the river to the north?
wildman We pulled five hundred men out of Osgiliath, but if the city is attacked, we won't hold it.
faramir Saruman attacks from Isengard. Sauron from Mordor. The fight will come to men on both fronts. Gondor is weak. Sauron will strike us soon. And he will strike hard. He knows now we do not have the strength to repel him.
sam My men tell me that you are orc spies.
faramir Spies! Now wait just a minute.
wildman Well if you're not spies, then who are you?
wildman Speak!
faramir We are hobbits of the Shire. Frodo Baggins is my name and this is Samwise Gamgee.
wildman Your bodyguard?
faramir His gardener.
wildman And where is your skulking friend? That gangrel creature. He had an ill-favored look.
faramir There was no other.
wildman We set out from Rivendell with seven companions. One we lost in Moria. Two were my kin. A dwarf there was also. And an elf. And two men. Aragorn, son of Arathorn and Boromir of Gondor.
faramir You were friend of Boromir?
faramir Yes, for my part.
crowd#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 It would grieve you then, to learn that he is dead?
crowd#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Dead? How? When?
denethor As one of his companions, I had hoped you would tell me.
denethor If something has happened to Boromir, we would have you tell us.
denethor His horn washed up upon the riverbank, about six days past. It was cloven in two.
crowd#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 But more than this, I know it in my heart. He was my brother.
denethor Boromir!
crowd#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Boromir!
denethor This city was once the jewel of our kingdom. A place of light, and beauty, and music. And so it shall be once more!
crowd#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode01 Let the armies of Mordor know this
faramir The city of Osgiliath has been reclaimed. For Gondor!
denethor For Gondor!
boromir For Gondor!
denethor For Gondor!
denethor For Gondor!
faramir For Gondor!
denethor Good speech. Nice and short.
rohan_man Leaves more time for drinking!
denethor Break out the ale! These men are thirsty!
rohan_man Remember today, little brother. Today, life is good.
denethor What?
rohan_man He is here.
faramir One moment of peace. Can he not give us that?
rohan_man Where is he? Where is Gondor's finest? Where is my first-born?
faramir Father!
denethor They say you vanquished the enemy almost single-handedly.
denethor They exaggerate. The victory belongs to Faramir also.
rohan_man But for Faramir, this city would still be standing. Were you not entrusted to protect it?
denethor I would have done, but our numbers were too few.
rohan_man Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in and take it on a whim. Always you cast a poor reflection on me.
denethor That is not my intent.
rohan_man You give him no credit and yet he tries to do your will.
denethor He loves you, Father.
rohan_man Do not trouble me with Faramir. I know his uses, and they are few. We have more urgent things to speak of. Elrond of Rivendell has called a meeting. He will not say why, but I have guessed its purpose. It is rumored that the weapon of the enemy has been found.
faramir The One Ring. Isildur's Bane.
rohan_man It has fallen into the hands of the Elves. Everyone will try to claim it
denethor Gondor.
voice_of_the_ring It's dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring will seek to corrupt the hearts of lesser men. But you, you are strong and our need is great. It is our blood which is being spilled, our people who are dying. Sauron is biding his time. He's massing fresh armies. He will return. And when he does, we will be powerless to stop him. You must go. Bring me back this mighty gift.
legolas No. My place is here with my people. Not in Rivendell.
faramir Would you deny your own father?
faramir If there is need to go to Rivendell, send me in his stead.
faramir You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality. I think not. I trust this mission only to your brother. The one who will not fail me.
faramir Remember today, little brother.
berserker_torchbearer_ The Two Towers
wildman Captain Faramir. We found it.
wildman You must come with me. Now.
berserker_torchbearer_ Down there.
wildman To enter the Forbidden Pool bears the penalty of death.
wildman They wait for my command. Shall they shoot?
berserker_torchbearer_ Rock and pool is nice and cool, so juicy sweet! I only wish to catch a fish, so juicy sweet!
faramir Wait. This creature is bound to me. And I to him. He is our guide. Please, let me go down to him.
faramir Sméagol. Master is here. Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come.
berserker_torchbearer_ We must — go now?
gollum Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow me, come on. Come. Come, Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. That's it. Come on.
berserker_torchbearer_ Don't hurt him! Sméagol don't struggle! Sméagol listen to me!
gollum Master!
berserker_torchbearer_ That is enough.
gollum Where are you leading them? Answer me!
berserker_torchbearer_ Sméagol. Why does it cry, Sméagol?
gollum Cruel men hurts us. Master tricksed us.
faramir Of course he did. I told you he was tricksy. I told you he was false.
berserker_torchbearer_ Master is our friend — our friend.
sam Master betrayed us!
sam No, not it's business. Leave us alone.
wildman Filthy little hobbitses! They stole it from us!
sam No… no.
faramir What did they steal?
faramir My… Precious! Argh!
faramir We have to get out of here. You go. Go now.
wildman You can do it. Use the Ring, Mister Frodo. Just this once. Put it on. Disappear.
sam I can't. You were right, Sam. You tried to tell me. I'm sorry. The Ring's taking me, Sam. If I put it on, he'll find me. He'll see.
legolas Mister Frodo…
sam So… this is the answer to all the riddles. Here in the wild I have you. Two haflings and a host of men at my call.
legolas And the Ring of Power within my grasp.
faramir A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, to show his quality.
faramir No!
voice_of_the_ring Stop it! Leave him alone! Don't you understand?! He's got to destroy it. That's where we're going. To Mordor. To the Mountain of Fire.
aragorn Osgiliath is under attack. They call for reinforcements.
gimli Please. It's such a burden. Will you not help him?
gimli Captain?
aragorn Prepare to leave.
legolas The Ring will go to Gondor.
legolas The Two Towers
aragorn Mae carnen, Brego, mellon nîn. (Well done, Brego, my friend.)
ugluk Where is he! Where is he! Get out of my way! I'm gonna kill him! You are the luckiest, the cunningest, and most reckless man I ever knew!
aragorn Bless you, laddie!
ugluk Gimli, where is the king?
aragorn Le abdollen. (You're late.)
ugluk You look terrible.
aragorn Hannon le. (Thank you.)
aragorn A great host, you say?
ugluk All Isengard is emptied.
ugluk How many?
theoden Ten thousand strong at least.
gimli Ten thousand?!
ugluk It is an army bred for a single purpose
ugluk They will be here by nightfall.
aragorn Let them come.
ugluk I want every man and strong lad able to bear arms, to be ready for battle by nightfall.
aragorn We will cover the causeway and the gate from above. No army has ever breached the deeping wall or set foot inside the Hornburg.
ugluk This is no rabble of mindless orcs. These are Uruk-hai. Their armor is thick and their shields broad.
aragorn I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf. I know how to defend my own keep.
ugluk They will break upon this fortress like water on rock. Saruman's hordes will pillage and burn, we've seen it before. Crops can be resown. Homes rebuilt. Within these walls, we will outlast them.
ugluk They do not come to destroy Rohan's crops or villages. They come to destroy its people. Down to the last child!
ugluk What would you have me do? Look at my men. Their courage hangs by a thread. If this is to be our end, then I would have them make such an end as to be worthy of remembrance!
wormtongue Send out riders, my lord. You must call for aid.
ugluk And who will come. Elves? Dwarves? We are not so lucky in our friends as you. The old alliances are dead.
wormtongue Gondor will answer.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Gondor? Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when our enemies closed in around us!?
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02merry Where was Gon — No, my Lord Aragorn, we are alone.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Get the women and children into the caves.
merry We need more time to lay provisions for a siege, lord —
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 There is no time. War is upon us!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Secure the gate.
voice_of_the_ring The Ents have not troubled about the wars of men and wizards for a very long time.
rohan_man But now something is about to happen that has not happened for an age
aragorn What's that?
legolas It is a gathering.
eowyn A gathering of what?
aragorn Beech, Oak, Chestnut, Ash. Good, good, good many have come.
eowyn Now we must decide if the Ents will go to war.
aragorn The Two Towers
eowyn Come on people! Quickly, now!
aragorn We'll place the reserves along the wall. They can support the archers from above the gate.
eowyn Aragorn, you must rest. You're no use to us half-alive.
eowyn Aragorn! I'm to be sent with the women into the caves.
aragorn That is an honorable charge.
aragorn To mind the children, to find food and bedding when the men return. What renown is there in that?
gimli My lady, a time may come for valor without renown. Who then will your people look to in the last defense?
legolas Let me stand at your side.
legolas It is not in my power to command it.
aragorn You do not command the others to stay! They fight beside you because they would not be parted from you. Because they love you.
legolas I'm sorry.
aragorn Farmers, farriers, stable boys.
gimli These are no soldiers.
wormtongue Most have seen too many winters!
ugluk Or too few. Look at them. They're frightened. I can see it in their eyes.
wormtongue Boe a hyn neled herain… dan caer menig! (And they should be. Three hundred… against ten thousand!)
ugluk Si beriathar hyn ammaeg na ned Edoras. (They have a better chance defending themselves here than in Edoras.)
wormtongue Aragorn, men i ndagor. Hýn ú ortheri. Natha daged aen! (They cannot win this fight. They are all going to die!)
ugluk Then I shall die as one them!
ugluk Let him go, lad. Let him be.
ugluk Every villager able to wield a sword has been sent to the armory. My lord?
ugluk Who am I, Gamling?
merry You are our king, sire.
urukhai_ And do you trust your king?
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Your men, my lord, will follow you to whatever end.
merry To whatever end.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Where is the horse and the rider. Where is the horn that was blowing.
merry They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow.
aragorn How did it come to this.
aragorn It's been going for hours.
haleth They must have decided something by now.
haleth Decided? No, we've only just finished saying good morning.
aragorn But it's nighttime already! You can't take forever.
aragorn Don't be hasty.
legolas We're running out of time!
aragorn Give me your sword.
gimli What is your name?
gimli Háleth, son of Háma, my lord.
legolaslegolas The men are saying that we will not live out the night. They say that it is hopeless.
ugluk This is a good sword, Háleth, son of Háma.
haldir There is always hope.
haldir We have trusted you this far and you have not led us astray. Forgive me. I was wrong to despair.
aragorn Ú-moe edamed, Legolas. (There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.)
aragorn If we had time, I'd get this adjusted.
haldir It's a little tight across the chest.
voice_of_the_ring That is no orc horn!
gimli Send for the king. Open the gate!
gimli How is this possible?
legolas I bring word from Elrond of Rivendell. An alliance once existed between elves and men. Long ago we fought and died together.
gimli We come to honor that allegiance.
aragorn Mae govannen, Haldir! (Welcome, Haldir!)
gimli You are most welcome.
legolas We are proud to fight alongside men, once more.
gimli The Two Towers
aragorn Argh. You could have picked a better spot.
ugluk Well lad, the luck you live by, let's hope it lasts the night.
legolas Your friends are with you, Aragorn.
aragorn Let's hope they last the night.
gimli A Eruchîn, ú-dano i faelas a hyn an uben tanatha le faelas! (Show them no mercy! For you shall receive none!)
ugluk What's happening out there?
wormtongue Shall I describe it to you? Or would you like me to find you a box?
aragorn (Laughs.)
gimli Dartho! (Hold!)
aragorn So it begins.
gimli Faeg i-varv dîn na lanc a nu ranc. (Their armor is weak at the neck and under the arms.)
gimli Leithio i philinn! (Fire!)
legolas Anybody hit anything?
gimli Give them a volley.
legolas Fire!
voice_of_the_ring Tangado a chadad! (Keep firing!)
urukhai_ Come on! Send them to me!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Pendraid! (Ladders!)
merry Good!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Legolas, two already!
urukhai_ I'm on seventeen!
merry Argh! I'll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Nineteen!
merry The Two Towers
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Merry.
gimli We have just agreed.
aragorn Yes?
ugluk I have told your names to the Entmoot and we have agreed
aragorn Well that's good news.
ugluk And what about Saruman? Have you come to a decision about him.
ugluk Now don't be hasty, Master Meriadoc.
aragorn Hasty?! Our friends are out there. They need our help! They cannot fight this war on their own.
aragorn War, yes. It affects us all. But you must understand, young hobbit. It takes a long time to say anything in old Entish, and we never say anything unless it is worth taking a long time to say.
aragorn Seventeen. Eighteen. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty-one. Twenty-two.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Northway! Nauthannen!
merry Is this it? Is this all you can conjure, Saruman?
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Togo hon dad, Legolas! Dago hon! (Legolas, stop him! Kill him!)
merry Brace the gates!
merry Hold them! Stand fast!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Gimli! Prepare to charge!
urukhai_ Hado i philinn! (Hurl the arrows!)
urukhai_ Herio! (Charge!)
merry The Ents cannot hold back this war. We must weather such things as we have always done.
merry How can that be your decision?!
voice_of_the_ring This is not our war.
ugluk But your part of this world! Aren't you?
aragorn You must help. Please. You must do something.
aragorn You are young and brave, master Merry. But your part in this tale is over. Go back to your home.
gimli Maybe Treebeard's right. We don't belong here, Merry. It's too big for us. What can we do in the end?
aragorn We've got the Shire. Maybe we should go home.
wormtongue The fires of Isengard will spread. And the woods of Tuckburough and Buckland will burn. And all that was once green and good in this world will be gone.
ugluk There won't be a Shire, Pippin.
wormtongue The Two Towers
ugluk Aragorn, pull back to the gate!
aragorn Am Marad! (To the Keep!)
ugluk Nan barad! Haldir! Nan barad! (Pull back! Haldir! Pull back!)
aragorn What are you doing? Stop it!
gimli Haldir!
aragorn Brace the gate!
gimli To the gate! Draw your swords!
aragorn We can't hold much longer.
gimli Hold them!
gimli How long do you need?
aragorn As long as you can give me!
ugluk Gimli!
ugluk Come on. We can take 'em!
legolas It's a long way.
ugluk Toss me.
wormtongue What?
ugluk I cannot jump the distance so you have to toss me.
wormtongue Eh… Don't tell the elf.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Not a word.
urukhai_ Shore up the door!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Gimli! Aragorn! Get out of there!
urukhai_ Aragorn!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Pull everybody back. Pull them back!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Fall back! Fall back!
merry They have broken through. The castle is breached! Retreat!
urukhai_ Fall back! Retreat! Retreat!
voice_of_the_ring I will leave you at the western borders of the forest. You can make your way north to your homeland from there.
legolas Wait! Stop! Stop! Turn around. Turn around. Take us south!
wildman South? But that will lead you past — Isengard.
wildman Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can slip past Saruman unnoticed. The closer we are to danger, the farther we are from harm. It's the last thing he'll expect.
faramir Hmm. That doesn't make sense to me. But then, you are very small. Perhaps your right. South it is then.
wildman Hold on, little Shirelings. I always like going south. Somehow it feels like going down hill.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Are you mad, we'll be caught.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 No we won't. Not this time.
urukhai_ The Two Towers
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Look. Osgiliath burns. Mordor has come.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 The Ring will not save Gondor. It has only the power to destroy.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Please, let me go.
urukhai_ Hurry.
merry Faramir, you must let me go!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 And a little family of field mice that climb up sometimes and it tickle me awfully. They're always trying to get somewhere —
merry Many of these trees were my friends. Creatures I had known from nut and acorn.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 I'm sorry, Treebeard.
isengard_orc_ They had voices of their own.
sam Saruman! A wizard should know better!
wildman There is no curse in elvish, entish or the tongues of men for this treachery.
sam Look at the trees, they're moving!
faramir Where are they going?
sam They have business with the orcs. My business is with Isengard tonight. With a rock and stone.
sam Yes!
sam Rárum-rum! Come my friends. The Ents are going to war. It is likely that we go to our doom. The last march of the Ents.
wildman Faramir, orcs have taken the eastern shore. Their numbers are too great. By nightfall we'll be overrun.
faramir Mister Frodo!
faramir It's calling to him, Sam. His eye is almost on me.
voice_of_the_ring Hold on, Mister Frodo.
ugluk Take them to my father. Tell him, Faramir sends a mighty gift. A weapon that will change our fortunes in this war.
aragorn You wanna know what happened to Boromir? You wanna know why your brother died?
aragorn He tried to take the Ring from Frodo. After swearing an oath to protect him. He tried to kill him! The Ring drove your brother mad!
aragorn Mister Frodo?
wormtongue They're here. They've come.
aragorn Nazgûl!
ugluk Stay here. Keep out of sight. Take cover!
aragorn The Two Towers
aragorn The fortress is taken. It is over.
ugluk You said this fortress would never fall while your men defend it. They still defend it. They have died defending it!
aragorn Is there no other way for the women and children to get out of the caves?
gimli Is there no other way?
gandalf There is one passage. It leads into the mountains. But they will not get far. The Uruk-hai are too many.
ugluk Send word for the women and children to make for the mountain pass. And barricade the entrance!
gimli So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate?
ugluk Ride out with me.
ugluk Ride out and meet them.
ugluk For death and glory?
aragorn For Rohan. For your people.
gondorian_ranger The sun is rising.
kissing_hobbit Look to my coming at first light on the fifth day. At dawn, look to the East.
kissing_hobbit Yes. Yes! The horn of Helm Hammerhand shall sound in the deep, one last time.
ugluk Yes!
kissing_hobbit Let this be the hour when we draw swords together.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath. Now for ruin. And the red dawn!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Forð Eorlingas!
merry Gandalf.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRings.Season01.Episode02 Théoden king stands alone.
voice_of_the_ring Not alone.
sam Rohirrim!
sam Èomer!
sam To the king!
sam A hit. A fine hit.
wildman Break the dam! Release the river!
sam Pippin, hold on!
sam Hold on, little hobbits!
sam The Two Towers
sam What are you doing?
sam Where are you going!
wildman It's me. It's your Sam.
sam Don't you know your Sam?
faramir I can't do this, Sam.
isengard_orc_ I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are.
faramir It's like in the great stories, Mister Frodo. The ones that really mattered.
voice_of_the_ring Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. Because how could the end be happy. How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened.
kissing_hobbit But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer.
legolas Those were the stories that stayed with you. That meant something. Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think, Mister Frodo, I do understand. I know now. Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back only they didn't. Because they were holding on to something.
gimli What are we holding on to, Sam?
gimli That there's some good in this world, Mister Frodo. And it's worth fighting for.
legolas I think at last we understand one another, Frodo Baggins.
gimli You know the laws of our country. The laws of your father. If you let them go, your life will be forfeit.
legolas Then it is forfeit. Release them.
gimli The Two Towers
merry Stay out of the forest! Keep away from the trees!
urukhai_ Final count
merry Fourty-two?! That's not bad for a pointy-eared Elvish princeling.
urukhai_urukhai_ I myself am sitting pretty on fourty-three.
merry Fourty-three.
urukhai_ He was already dead.
merry He was twitching.
merry He was twitching because he's got my axe embedded in his nervous system!
urukhai_ He doesn't look too happy, does he?
merry Not too happy at all, Merry.
urukhai_ Still, I suppose the view would be quite nice form up there.
merry Oh yes, a quality establishment. I hear the staff are very good.
urukhai_ What are you doing?
merry Nothing. The world's back to normal, that's all.
urukhai_ No it isn't. I'm starving.
merry Good luck trying to find something decent around here. Probably only dead rats and moldy bread.
faramir Saruman's storeroom!
sam I don't believe it.
faramir It can't be.
wildman It is.
faramir Longbottom Leaf. The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
faramir It's perfect. One barrel each. Wait. Do you think we should share it with Treebeard?
berserker_torchbearer_ Share it? No. No. Dead plant and all that. Don't think he'd understand. Could be a distant relative.
faramir I get it. Don't be hasty.
berserker_torchbearer_ Exactly. Bar-hrum.
wildman This is the old sewer. Runs right under the river through to the edge of the city. You'll find cover in the woods there.
faramir Captain Faramir, you have shown your quality, sir. The very highest.
wildman The Shire must truly be a great realm, Master Gamgee, where gardeners are held in high honor. What road will you take once you reach the woods?
faramir Gollum says there's a path near Minas Morgul that climbs up into the mountains.
sam Cirith Ungol?
berserker_torchbearer_ Is that it's name?
sam No. No! Yes.
berserker_torchbearer_ Frodo, they say a dark terror dwells in the passes above Minas Morgul. You cannot go that way.
sam It is the only way. Master says we must go to Mordor, so we must try.
voice_of_the_ring I must.
gondorian_ranger Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of all Men.
gondorian_ranger Thank you.
sam May death find you quickly if you bring them to harm.
wildman Come on. Keep up! Mister Frodo didn't mean for them Rangers to hurt you. You know that, don't you? He was tryin' to save you, see?
sam Save me?
wildman So there's no hard feelings. Forgive and forget.
wildman No, no. No hard feelings.
sam Very decent of you. Very decent indeed, Gollum.
wildman The Two Towers
sam Sauron's wrath will be terrible, his retribution swift.
wildman The battle for Helm's Deep is over. The battle for Middle-Earth is about to begin. All our hopes now lie with two little hobbits. Somewhere in the wilderness.
sam I wonder if we'll ever be put into songs or tales.
gollum What?
berserker_torchbearer_ I wonder if people will ever say, 'Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring.' And they'll say 'Yes, that's one of my favorite stories. Frodo was really courageous, wasn't he, dad.' 'Yes, my boy, the most famousest of hobbits. And that's saying a lot.'
gollum You left out one of the chief characters. Samwise the Brave. I want to hear more about Sam.
berserker_torchbearer_ Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam.
gollum Now Mister Frodo, you shouldn't make fun. I was being serious.
gollum So was I.
berserker_torchbearer_ Samwise the Brave.
gollum Sméagol!
berserker_torchbearer_ We're not gonna wait for you. Come on.
gollum Master — Master looks after us. Master wouldn't hurt us.
sam Master broke his promise!
wildman Don't ask Sméagol. Poor, poor Sméagol.
berserker_torchbearer_ Master betrayed us! Wicked, tricksy, false! We ought to ring his filthy little neck!
gollum Kill him! Kill him! Kill them both. Then we take the Precious and we be the master.
berserker_torchbearer_ But the fat hobbit. He knows. Eyes always watching.
gollum Then we stabs them out. Put out his eyses. And make him crawl.
gollum Yes! Yes! Yes!
berserker_torchbearer_ Kill them both.

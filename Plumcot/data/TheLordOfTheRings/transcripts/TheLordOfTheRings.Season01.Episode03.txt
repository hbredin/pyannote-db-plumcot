gandalf Sméagol! I've got one! I've got a fish, Sméag!
gollum Go on! Go on, pull it up!
gollum Déagol?
gollum Déagol! Déagol!
gollum Give us that, Déagol, my love.
gandalf Why?
gollum Because it's my birthday, and I wants it.
voice_of_the_ring Ash nazg durbatulûk, ash nazg gimbatul, ash nazg thrakatulûk agh burzum-ishi krimpatul!
gollum My Precious!
gollum They cursed us. Murderer, murderer they called us. They cursed us and drove us away!
gollum Gollum! Gollum! Gollum!
gollum And we wept, Precious. We wept to be so alone. (Fish, and we only wish, so juicy sweet.) And we forgot the taste of bread, the sound of trees, the softness of the wind.
gollum We even forgot our own name. My Precious.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! We must go, yes. We must go at once.
easterling Haven't you had any sleep, Mister Frodo?
easterling I've gone an' had too much. Must be getting late.
frodo No. It isn't. It isn't midday yet. The days are growing darker.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Come on! Must go, no time!
easterling Not before Mister Frodo's had something to eat.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier No time to lose, silly!
easterling Here.
frodo What about you?
sam Oh no, I'm not hungry. Leastwise not for Lembas bread.
frodo Sam.
easterling All right, we don't have that much left. We have to be careful, or we're goin' to run out. You go ahead and eat that, Mister Frodo. I've rationed it.
easterling There should be enough.
frodo For what?
easterling The journey home.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Come, hobbitses! Very close now. Very close to Mordor. No safe places here. Hurry!
voice_of_the_ring The Return of the King
merry It's good. Definately from the Shire.
merry Longbottom Leaf, eh?
pippin I feel like I'm back at the Green Dragon…
merry Hmm, Green Dragon.
pippin A mug of ale in my hand, putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.
merry Only, you've never done a hard day's work.
merry Welcome, my Lords… to Isengard!
gimli You young rascals! A merry chase you've led us on, and now we find you feasting and… and smoking!
pippin We are sitting on the field of victory, enjoying a few well-earned comforts. The salted pork is particularly good.
gimli Salted pork? (smiles)
gandalf Hobbits.
merry We're under orders from Treebeard, who's taken over management of Isengard.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Young master Gandalf, I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, stock and stone I can master, but there's a Wizard to manage here, locked in his tower.
aragorn Show yourself.
gandalf Be careful; even in defeat Saruman is dangerous.
gimli Then let's just have his head and be done with it.
gandalf No, we need him alive. We need him to talk.
saruman You have fought many wars and slain many men Théoden king, and made peace afterwards.
saruman Can we not take council together, as we once did, my old friend? Can we not have peace, you and I?
theoden We shall have peace.
theoden We shall have peace… when you answer for the burning of the westfold, and the children that lie dead there. We shall have peace, when the lives of the soldiers, whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged! When you hang from a gibbet for the sport of your own crows… we shall have peace.
saruman Gibbets and crows? Dotard!
saruman What do you want Gandalf Greyhame? Let me guess
gandalf Your treachary has already cost many lives. Thousands more are now at risk, but you could save them Saruman. You were deep in the enemy's council.
saruman So you have come here for information. I have some for you.
saruman Something festers in the heart of Middle-Earth. Something that you have failed to see. But the Great Eye has seen it. Even now he presses his advantage. His attack will come soon.
saruman You're all going to die.
saruman But you know this don't you, Gandalf.
saruman You cannot think that this Ranger will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor. This exile, crept from the shadows, will never be crowned king.
saruman Gandlaf does not hesistate to sacrifice those closest to him, those he professes to love. Tell me… what words of confort did you give the halfling before you sent him to his doom?
saruman The path that you have set him on can only lead to death.
gimli I've heard enough. [to Legolas] Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.
gandalf No.
gandalf Come down Saruman, and your live will be spared.
saruman Save your pity and your mercy; I have no use for it!
gandalf Saruman, your staff is broken.
theoden Gríma, you need not follow him. You were not always as you are now. You were once a man of Rohan! Come down.
saruman A man of Rohan? What is the house of Rohan but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek and rats roll on the floor with the dogs? Victory at helms deep does not belong to you, Théoden, horsemaster! You are a lesser son of greater sires.
theoden Gríma, come down. Be free of him.
saruman Free? He will never be free.
grima No.
saruman Get down, cur!
gandalf Saruman, you were deep in the enemy's council. Tell us what you know.
saruman You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you where you doom will be decided.
saruman I will not be held prisoner here.
gandalf Send word to all our allies, and to every corner of Middle-Earth that still stands free. The enemy moves against us. We need to know where he will strike.
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 The filth of Saruman is washing away. Trees will come back to live here. Young trees, wild trees.
aragorn Pippin!
treebeard#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Bless my bark!
gandalf Peregrin Took, I'll take that, my lad. Quickly now!
voice_of_the_ring The Return of the King
theoden Tonight we remember those who gave their blood to defend this country. Hail the victorious dead!
crowd#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Hail!
eomer No pauses, no spills.
gimli And no regurgitation.
legolas So it's a drinking game?
gimli Aye, Last one standing wins. [laughs]
rohan_men#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory! To victory!
eowyn Westu, Aragorn, hál. (Be-thou Aragorn well.)
theoden I am happy for you. He is an honorable man.
eowyn You are both honorable men.
theoden It was not Théoden of Rohan who led our people to victory.
theoden Ah, don't listen to me. You are young and tonight is for you.
gimli Here, here. It's the dwarves that go swimming with little hairy women.
legolas I feel something. A slight tingling in my fingers. I think it's affecting me.
gimli What did I say? He cant hold his liquor!
legolas Game over.
merry_and_pippin#together Oh, you can search far and wide You can drink the whole town dry But you'll never find a beer so brown As the one we drink in our home town.
merry You can keep your fancy ales. You can drink em by the flagon But the only brew for the brave and true…
merry_and_pippin#together Pippin!
pippin …But the only brew for the brave and true Comes from the Green Dragon!
aragorn I win!
gandalf No news of Frodo?
aragorn No word. Nothing.
gandalf We have time. Every day Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
aragorn Do we know that?
gandalf What does your heart tell you?
voice_of_the_ring That Frodo is alive. Yes. Yes, he is alive.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier The Return of the King
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Too risky, Too risky. Thieves! They stole It from us. Kill them, kill them, kill them both!
gollum Shhh! Quiet! Mustn't wake them! Mustn't ruin it now!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier But they knows! They knows! They suspects us!
gollum What's it saying, my precious, my love? Is Sméagol losing his nerve?
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier No! Not! Never! Sméagol hates nasty hobbitses! Sméagol wants to see them… dead!
gollum And we will. Sméagol did it once. He can do it again.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier It's ours! Ours! We must get the Precious! We must get It back!
gollum Patience! Patience, my love. First we must lead them to her.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier We lead them to the winding stairs.
gollum Yes, the stairs. And then?
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Up, up, up, up the stairs we go. And then we come to the tunnel.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier And when they go in, there's no coming out. She's always hungry. She always needs to feed.
gollum She must eat. All she gets is filthy orcses.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?
gollum No, not very nice at all, my love. She hungers for sweeter meats. Hobbit meat. And when she throws away the bones and empty clothes, then we will find It!
gollum And take it for me!
gollum For us.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Yes, we meant, we meant for us.
easterling Gollum! Gollum! The Precious will be ours once the hobbitses are dead.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier You treacherous little thief!
frodo Argh! No! Master!
easterling No, Sam! Leave him alone!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier I heard it from his own mouth! He means to murder us!
easterling Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly! He's a hobbit, fat hobbit who hates Sméagol and who makes up nasty lies!
frodo You miserable little maggot! I'll stave your head in!
easterling Sam!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Called me a liar! You're a liar!
frodo Ah!
easterling We scare him off, we're lost!
frodo I don't care! I can't do it, Mister Frodo! I won't wait around for him to kill us!
easterling I'm not sending him away!
frodo You don't see it, do you? He's a villain.
easterling We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. Not without a guide. I need you on my side.
frodo I am on your side, Mister Frodo.
voice_of_the_ring I know, Sam. I know. Trust me. Come, Sméagol.
eowyn The Return of the King
aragorn What time is it?
eowyn Not yet dawn.
eowyn I dreamed I saw a great wave, climbing over green lands and above the hills. I stood upon the brink. It was uppterly dark in the abyss before my feet.
aragorn A light shone behind me but I could not turn. I could only stand there, waiting.
aragorn Night changes many thoguhts. Sleep, Éowyn.
legolas Sleep… while you can.
merrymerry The stars are veiled. Something stirs in the East. A sleepless malice. The Eye of the enemy is moving.
pippin What are you doing? Pippin! Pippin?
merry Pippin! Are you mad?
merry I just want to look at it! Just one more time.
legolas Put it back!
sauron Pippin. No! Pippin!
merry He is here!
merry I see you!
gandalf Pippin! Help! Gandalf Help him! Someone help him!
gandalf Pippin!
pippin Fool of a Took!
gandalf Look at me.
pippin Gandalf! Forgive me!
gandalf Look at me. What did you see?
pippin A tree… there was a white tree in a courtyard of stone… it was dead. The city was burning.
gandalf Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
pippin I saw… I saw Him! I could hear His voice in my head!
pippin And what did you tell Him? Speak!
gandalf He asked me my name. I didn't answer.
voice_of_the_ring He hurt me!
gandalf What did you tell Him about Frodo and the Ring?
gandalf The Return of the King
gandalf There was no lie in Pippin's eyes. A fool… but an honest fool he remains. He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
gandalf We've been strangely fortunate. Pippin saw in the Palantír a glimpse of the enemy's plan. Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
theoden His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing
theoden He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground before he sees a King return to the throne of men. If the Beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
aragorn Tell me… why should we ride to the aid of those who did not come to ours?
gandalf What do we owe Gondor?
aragorn I will go.
gandalf No!
gandalf They must be warned!
gandalf They will be. You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
gandalfgandalf Follow the river and look to the black ships.
pippin Understand this
merry And I won't be going alone.
pippin Of all the inquisitive hobbits, Peregrin Took, you are the worst! Hurry! Hurry!
merry Where are we going?
pippin Why did you look? Why do you always have to look!
merry I don't know. I can't help it!
pippin You never can.
pippin I'm sorry, all right! I won't do it again.
merry Don't you understand? The enemy thinks you have the Ring! He's going to be looking for you, Pip. They have to get you out of here.
pippin And y-you're coming with me?
gandalf Merry?
merry Come on!
pippin How far is Minas Tirith?
merry Three day's ride, as the Nazgûl flies. And we better hope we don't have one of those on our tail.
pippin Here. Something for the road.
merry Last of the Longbottom Leaf?
pippin I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pip.
gandalf But we'll see each other soon, won't we?
pippin I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen.
aragorn Merry!
merry Run, Shadowfax. Show us the meaning of haste.
merry Merry!
aragorn Merry!
merry He's always followed me. Everywhere I went, since before we were were tweens. I would get him into the worst sort of trouble. But I was always there to get him out. And now he's gone.
voice_of_the_ring Just like Frodo, and Sam.
elrond One thing I've learned about hobbits
elrond Foolhardy maybe. He's a Took.
barliman_butterbur The Return of the King
barliman_butterbur Take her by the safest road. A ship lays anchored in the Grey Havens. It waits to carry her across the Sea… The last journey of Arwen Undómiel.
arwen There is nothing for you here, only death.
goblin Lady Arwen, we cannot delay.
arwen My lady!
goblin Tell me what you have seen!
arwen Arwen!
goblin You have the gift of foresight, what did you see?
arwen I looked into your future and I saw death.
goblin But there was also life. You saw there was a child. You saw my son.
arwen But that future is almost gone.
arwen But it is not lost!
arwen Nothing is certain.
arwen Some things are certain! If I leave him now, I will regret it forever.
goblin It is time.
arwen From the ashes a fire shall be woken a light from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be Blade that was broken The crownless again shall be King.
voice_of_the_ring Reforge this Sword… Ada. (father)
gandalf Your hands are cold. The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
gandalf This was my choice. Adar, whether by your will or not, there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
gandalf The Return of the King
pippin We have just passed into the realm of Gondor!
gandalf Minas Tirith, City of Kings.
gandalf Make way!
gandalf It's the tree, Gandalf. Gandalf!
gandalf Yes, the White Tree of Gondor, the tree of the King. Lord Denethor however is not the king. He is a steward only. A caretaker of the throne.
gandalf Listen carefully
gandalf And do not mention about Frodo or the Ring.
denethor_ And say nothing of Aragorn either.
pippin In fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
gandalf Hail, Denethor, son of Ecthelion, Lord and Steward of Gondor. I come with tidings in this dark hour… and with counsel.
pippin Perhaps you've come to explain this. Perhaps you've come to tell me why my son is dead.
denethor_ Boromir died to save us, my kinsmen and me. He fell defending us from many foes.
pippin Pippin!
gandalf I offer you my service, such as it is, in payment of this debt.
gandalf This is my first command to you
gandalf The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow, and Boromir was pierced by many.
denethor_ Get up!
denethor_ My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming. The enemy is on your doorstep! As Steward, you're charged with the defense of this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
denethor_ You still have friends. You're not alone in this fight. Send word to Théoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
gandalf You think you are wise, Mithrandir, yet for all your subtleties you have not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of the White Towers are blind? I have seen more than you know.
denethor_ With your left hand you would use me as a shield against Mordor. And, with your right, you seek to supplant me!
gandalf I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan. Oh, yes. Words have reached my ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I tell you now
gandalf Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the King, Steward!
gandalf The whole rule of Gondor is mine! And no other's!
gandalf Come!
pippin All has turned to vain ambition!
gandalf He would even use his grief as a cloak.
gandalf A thousand years this city has stood. Now, at the whim of a madman it will fall. The White Tree, the tree of the king, will never bloom again.
gandalf Why are they still guarding it?
pippin They guard it because they have hope. A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower. A King will come, and this city will be as it once was, before it fell into decay.
gandalf The old wisdom bourne out of the west was forsaken. Kings made made tombs more splendid than the houses of the living, and counted the old names of their descent dearer than the names of their sons.
pippin Childless lords sat in aged halls musing on herladry, or in high cold towers asking questions of the stars. And so the people of gondor fell into run. The line of kings failed. The white tree whithered. The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
gandalf Mordor.
pippin Yes, there it lies. This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.
gandalf A storm is coming.
voice_of_the_ring This is not the weather of the world. This is the device of of Sauron's making. A broil of fumes he sends ahead of his host. The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight. So he covers the face of the sun to ease their passage along the road to war. When the shadow of Mordor reaches this city, it will begin.
easterling Well… Minas Tirith. Very impressive. So where are we off to next?
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Oh it's too late for that, Peregrin. There's no leaving this city. Help must come to us.
easterling The Return of the King
frodo It must be getting near teatime. Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.
easterling We're not in decent places.
easterling Mister Frodo? What is it?
frodo It's just a feeling. I don't think I'll be coming back.
easterling Yes you will, of course you will. That's just morbid thinking.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier We're goin there and back again, just like Mister Bilbo. You'll see.
pippin I think these lands were once part of the kingdom of Gondor. Long ago, when there was a king.
pippin Mister Frodo, look. The king has got a crown again.
gandalf Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.
gandalf So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
gandalf I mean, they don't actually expect me to do any fighting… do they?
pippin You're in the service of the Steward now; you're going to have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.
gandalf Ridiculous Hobbit. 'Guard of the Citadel.'
pippin Thank you.
gandalf There's no more stars. Is it time?
pippin Yes.
gandalf It's so quiet.
gandalf It's the deep breath before the plunge.
pirate#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 I don't want to be in a battle, but waiting on the edge of one I can't escape is even worse! Is there any hope, Gandalf? For Frodo and Sam?
gandalf There never was much hope. Just a fool's hope.
pippin Our enemy is ready, his full strength gathers. Not only orcs, but men as well, legions of Haradrim from the South, mercenaries from the coast… all will answer Mordor's call.
gandalf Come on!
gandalf This will be the end of Gondor as we know it. Here the hammer stroke will fall the hardest. If the river is taken, if the garrison at Osgiliath falls, the last defense of this city will be gone.
gandalf But we have the White Wizard… that's got to count for something. Gandalf?
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant. The one who would lead Mordor's armies in war. The one they say no living man can kill
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier You've met him before. He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier He is the lord of the Nazgûl, the greatest of the nine. Minas Morgul is his lair.
easterling The Dead City… very nasty place… full of… enemies.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Quick! Quick! They will see! They will see! Come away! Come away!
easterling Look! We have found it, the way into Mordor. The Secret Stairs! Climb!
frodo No! Mister Frodo!
frodo Not that way! What's it doing?
gandalf No!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier They're calling me.
gandalf I can feel his blade.
voice_of_the_ring We come to it at last, the great battle of our time.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Hurry, hobbits! We climb! We must climb!
easterling The board is set. The pieces are moving.
easterling The Return of the King
easterling Up, up, up the stairs we go. And then it's into the tunnel.
easterling Hey, what's in this tunnel?
easterling You listen to me and you listen good and proper.
frodo Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.
easterling One stiff something's not right, one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over. No more slinker. No more stinker. You're gone. Got it?
gandalf I'm watching you.
gandalf What was that about?
madril Nothing, just clearing something up.
gothmog_ Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done. Another opportunity for one of the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
everard_proudfoot You must not fail me.
rohan_recruit It's been very quiet across the river. The Orcs are lying low. The garrison may have moved out. We've sent scouts to Cair Andros. If the Orcs attack from the north, we'll have some warning.
faramir Quiet!
faramir We need ten more.
rohan_recruit Kill him!
everard_proudfoot They're not coming from the north.
gandalf To the river! Quick, quick! Come on!
hama Faster! Draw swords!
gandalf Fight, Fight!
aragorn Amon Dîn.
aragorn The beacon! The beacon of Amon Dîn is lit!
theoden Hope is rekindled.
theoden The Beacons of Minas Tirith! The Beacons are lit!
theoden Gondor calls for aid!
theoden And Rohan will answer.
theoden Muster the Rohirrim!
gamling Assemble the army at Dunharrow, as many men as can be found. You have two days.
theoden On the third, we ride for Gondor. And war.
aragorn Gamling…
eowyn Lord.
eowyn Make haste across the Riddermark. Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
merry You ride with us?
merry Just to the encampment. It's tradition for the women of the court to farewell the men.
theoden The men have found their captain, they will follow you into battle, even to death. You have given us hope.
gimli Excuse me. I have a sword. Please accept it.
legolas I offer you my service, Theoden King.
theoden And gladly I accept it. You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.
eomer Horsemen, hmph! I wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.
voice_of_the_ring Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war. I fear war already marches on their own lands.
madril So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith, the doom of our time will be decided.
madril Now is the hour, Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken! Now, fulfill them all! To Lord and Land!
faramir The Return of the King
everard_proudfoot Faramir!
faramir We can't hold them! The city is lost.
faramir Tell the men to break cover. We ride to Minas Tirith.
everard_proudfoot Nazgûl! Take cover!
rohan_recruit Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!
gondorian_soldier_1 Retreat! Retreat!
faramir This way!
irolas The age of Men is over. The time of the Orc has come.
gandalf It's the White Rider!
gandalf Mithrandir! They broke our defenses. They've taken the bridge and the West bank. Battalions of orcs are crossing the river.
faramir It is as Lord Denethor predicted! Long has he foreseen this doom!
pippin Foreseen and done nothing!
gandalf Faramir? This is not the first halfling to have crossed your path?
faramir No.
gandalf You've seen Frodo and Sam!
pippin Where? When?
gandalf In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
denethor_ And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.
faramir What does that mean? What's wrong?
denethor_ Faramir, tell me everything. Tell me all you know.
denethor_ This is how you would serve your city? You would risk its utter ruin?
faramir I did what I judged to be right.
denethor_ What you judged to be right? You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor in the hands of a witless halfling.
faramir It should have been brought back to the Citadel to be kept safe. Hidden. Dark and deep in the vaults, not to be used. Unless at the uttermost… end of need.
denethor_ I would not use the Ring. Not if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin and I alone could save her.
faramir Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious as a king of old. Boromir would have remembered his father's need. He would have brought me a kingly gift.
denethor_ Boromir would not have brought the Ring. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.
faramir You know nothing of this matter!
denethor_ He would have kept it for his own! And when he returned, you would not have known your son.
denethor_ Boromir was loyal to me! Not some wizard's pupil!
voice_of_the_ring Father?
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier My son!
easterling Leave me!
easterling The Return of the King
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Careful, master! Very far to fall! Very dangerous on the stairs. Come, master! Come to Sméagol!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Mister Frodo!
gollum Get back, you! Don't touch him!
gollum Why does he hates poor Sméagol? What has Sméagol ever done to him?
breelander Master, Master carries a heavy burden. Sméagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden. Fat one cannot know. Let Sméagol look after Master.
rohan_recruit He wants It. He needs It, Sméagol sees it in his eyes!
breelander Very soon he will ask you for It! You will see! The fat one will take It from you!
soldier#1#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Send forth all legions. Do not stop the attack until the city is taken. Slay them all.
soldier#2#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 What of the wizard?
gandalf I will break him.
pippin Where are Théoden's riders?
faramir Will Rohan's army come? Mithrandir?
faramir Courage is the best defense that you have now.
pippin What were you thinking, Peregrin Took? What service can a Hobbit offer such a great lord of Men?
faramir It was well done.
pippin A generous deed should not be checked with cold counsel. You are to join the tower guard.
faramir I didn't think they would find any livery that would fit me.
pippin Once belonged to a young boy of the city. A very foolish one who wasted many hours slaying dragons instead of attending to his studies.
faramir This was yours?
pippin Yes, it was mine. My father had it made for me.
pippin Well… I'm taller than you were then. Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.
denethor_ Never fitted me either. Boromir was always the soldier. They were so alike, he and my father. Proud. Stubborn even. But strong.
denethor_ I think you have strength of a different kind. And one day your father will see it.
denethor_ Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor. In peace or war. In living or dying. Fr… from… from… from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death… take me.
faramir And I shall not forget it. Nor fail to reward that which is given.
denethor_ Fealty with love. Valor with honor. (to Faramir) Disloyalty with vengeance.
faramir I do not think we should so lightly abandon the outer defenses. Defenses that your brother long held intact.
denethor_ What would you have me do?
faramir I will not yield the river and Pelennor unfought. Osgiliath must be retaken.
denethor_ My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
faramir Much must be risked in war. Is there a Captain here who still has the courage to do his lord's will?
faramir You wish now that our places had been exchanged. That I had died and Boromir had lived.
denethor_ Yes. I wish that.
voice_of_the_ring Since you are robbed of Boromir, I will do what I can in his stead.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier If I should return, think better of me, father.
easterling That will depend on the manner of your return.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier The Return of the King
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Ugh!
easterling Where are you off to? Sneaking off are we?
gollum Sneaking? Sneaking! Fat hobbit is always so polite.
easterling Sméagol shows them secret ways that nobody else could find and they say sneak. Sneak? Very nice friend. Oh yes, my precious, very nice, very…
easterling All right! All right! You just startled me, that's all. What are you doing?
frodo Sneaking.
easterling Fine. Have it you own way.
easterling I'm sorry to wake you, Mister Frodo. We have to be moving on.
frodo It's dark still.
sam It's always dark here.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier It's gone! The elven bread!
easterling What? That's all we have left!
frodo He took it! He must have!
gollum Sméagol? No, no, no poor Sméagol. Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread.
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier You lying rat! What did you do with it!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier He doesn't eat it. He can't have taken it!
easterling Look, what's this?
frodo Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it. He took it!
easterling I've seen him. He is always stuffing his face when Master is not looking.
frodo That's a filthy lie! You stinking filth face!
easterling Sam! Stop it! No, Sam!
frodo I'll kill him!
easterling Sam! No!
easterling Oh my! I'm sorry! I didn't mean it to go so far. I was just so, so angry. Here. You just… just rest a bit.
sam I'm all right.
frodo No, no you're not all right. You're exhausted. It's that Gollum. It's this place. It's that thing around your neck.
easterling I… could help a bit. I could carry it for a while…
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier carry it for a while… I could carry it… carry it… share the load… the load.
easterling Get away!
frodo I don't want to keep it! I just want to help!
easterling See? See! He wants it for himself.
frodo Shut up you! Go away! Get out of here!
easterling No Sam. It's you. I'm sorry, Sam.
frodo But, he's a liar! He's poisoned you against me!
voice_of_the_ring You can't help me anymore.
gandalf You don't mean that.
faramir Go home.
faramir The Return of the King
gandalf Faramir, Faramir! Your father's will is turned to madness. Do not throw away your life so rashly.
denethor_ Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
pippin This is the city of the Men of Númenor. I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty, her memory, her wisdom.
denethor_ Your father loves you, Faramir. He will remember it before the end.
pippin Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
pippin Well, yes. At least, well enough for my own people. But, we have no songs for great halls and… evil times.
pippin And why should your songs be unfit for my halls? Come, sing me a song.
theoden Home is behind, the world ahead and there are many paths to tread.
grimbold Through shadow to the edge of night until the stars are all alight.
gamling Mist and shadow cloud and shade all shall fade, all shall fade.
theoden Grimbold, how many?
gamling I bring five hundred men from the Westfold, my Lord.
theoden We have three hundred more from Fenmarch.
aragorn Where are the riders from Snowbourn?
theoden None have come, my Lord.
aragorn Six thousand spears. Less than half of what I'd hoped for.
legolas Six thousand will not be enough to break the lines of Mordor.
eomer More will come.
gimli Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat. We have till dawn. Then we must ride.
legolas The horses are restless, and the men are quiet.
eomer They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
gimli That road there, where does that lead?
eowyn It is the road to the Dimholt; the door under the the mountain.
merry None who venture there ever return. That mountain is evil.
merry Aragorn, let's find some food.
eowyn There. A true esquire of Rohan.
eomer I'm ready!
eowyn Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous. It's not even sharp.
eomer Well that's no good. You won't kill many orcs with a blunt blade. Come on! To the smithy, go!
eowyn You should not encourage him.
eomer You should not doubt him.
eomer I do not doubt his heart, just the reach of his arm.
voice_of_the_ring Why should Merry be left behind? He has as much cause go to war as you! Why can he not fight for those he loves?
arwen You know as little of war as that Hobbit. When the fear takes him, and the blood and the screams and the horror of battle take hold, do you think he would stand and fight?
everard_proudfoot He would flee, and he would be right to do so. War is the province of men, Éowyn.
theoden The Return of the King
aragorn I choose a mortal life. I wish I could have seen him, one last time.
goblin Sir? King Théoden awaits you, my Lord.
goblin I take my leave.
aragorn My Lord, Elrond.
goblin I come on behalf of one whom I love.
goblin Arwen is dying. She will not long survive the evil that now spreads from Mordor. The light of the Evenstar is failing. As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The shadow is upon us, Aragorn. The end has come.
goblin It will not be our end but His.
aragorn You ride to war but not to victory.
goblin Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, as you know, but in secret He sends another force, which will attack from the river. A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the South. They'll be in the city in two days.
aragorn You're outnumbered, Aragorn. You need more men.
goblin There are none.
goblin There are those who… dwell in the mountain.
aragorn Murderers! Traitors! You would call upon them to fight? They believe in nothing! They answer to no one.
aragorn They will answer to the King of Gondor!
goblin Andúril… Flame of the West. Forged from the shards of Narsil.
goblin Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.
aragorn The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
eowyn The man who can wield the power of this sword can summon to him an army more deadly than any that walks this earth. Put aside the ranger. Become who you were born to be. Take the Dimholt road.
eowyn Ónen i-Estel Edain. (I gave Hope to the Dúnedain.)
aragorn Ú-chebin Estel anim. (I have kept no hope for myself.)
eowyn Why are you doing this? The war lies to the East. You cannot leave on the eve of battle!
aragorn You cannot abandon the men.
eowyn Éowyn…
aragorn We need you here.
aragorn Why have you come?
gimli Do you not know?
aragorn It is but a shadow and a thought that you love. I cannot give you what you seek.
legolas I have you wished you joy since first I saw you.
gimli Just where do you think you're off to?
soldier_1#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Not this time. This time you must stay, Gimli.
soldier_2#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Have you learned nothing of the stubbornness of dwarves?
soldier_3#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Might as well accept it. We're going with you, laddie.
soldier_4#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 What's happening?
soldier_5#unknown#TheLordOfTheRing.Season01.Episode03 Where's he going?
gamling I don't understand.
theoden Lord Aragorn!
gamling Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
theoden He leaves because there is no hope.
theoden He leaves because he must.
voice_of_the_ring Too few have come. We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
theoden No, we cannot.
theoden But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
eowyn The Return of the King
theoden I have left instructions. The people are to follow your rule in my stead.
theoden Take up my seat in the Golden Hall. Long may you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
gimli What other duty would you have me do, my lord?
legolas Duty? No. I would have you smile again. Not grieve for those whose time has come.
legolaslegolas You shall live to see these days renewed. No more despair.
gimli What kind of army would linger in such a place?
legolas One that is cursed.
aragorn Long ago the Men of the Mountain swore an oath to the last king of Gondor, to come to his aid, to fight. But when the time came, when Gondor's need was dire, they fled, vanishing into the darkness of the mountain. And so Isildur cursed them, never to rest, until they had fulfilled their pledge.
aragorn Who shall call them from the grey twilight? The forgotten people. The heir of him to whom the oath they swore. From the north shall he come. Need shall drive him. He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.
gimli The very warmth of my blood seems stole away.
theoden 'The way is shut. It was made by those who were dead, and the dead keep it. The way is shut.'
theoden Brego!
merry I do not fear death!
theoden Well this is something unheard of! An elf will go underground where a dwarf dare not! Ah, I'd never hear the end of it!
merry We must ride light and swift. It's a long road ahead. The men and beast must reach the end with a strength to fight.
theoden Little hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
eowyn All my friends have gone to battle. I will be ashamed to be left behind!
merry It is a three day gallop to Minas Tirith and none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
eomer I want to fight!
theoden I will say no more.
voice_of_the_ring Ride with me.
gimli My lady!
legolas Form up! Move out!
gimli Ride! Ride now for Gondor!
legolas The Return of the King
gimli What is it? What do you see?
aragorn I see shapes of men and of horses.
king_of_the_dead Where?
aragorn Pale banners like shreds of cloud. Spears rise like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist. The dead are following. They have been summoned.
king_of_the_dead The Dead? Summoned? I knew that. Very good. Very good. Legolas!
aragorn Do not look down.
king_of_the_dead Who enters my domain?
king_of_the_dead One who will have your allegiance.
aragorn The dead do not suffer the living to pass.
king_of_the_dead You will suffer me!
king_of_the_dead The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead. And the dead keep it.
aragorn The way is shut. Now you must die.
aragorn I summon you to fulfill your oath.
aragorn None but the King of Gondor may command me!
gimli That bind was broken!
aragorn It has been remade.
aragorn Fight for us, and regain your honor. What say you?
gimli What say you?
aragorn You waste your time, Aragorn! They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.
aragorn I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me and I will hold your oaths fulfilled! What say you!
king_of_the_dead You have my word! Fight, and I will release you from this living death! What say you?

eomer Take heart Merry. It will soon be over.
theoden My lady, you are fair and brave and have much to live for, and many who love you. I know it is too late to turn aside.
eowyn I know there is not much point now in hoping. If I were a knight of Rohan capable of great deeds… but I'm not. I'm a Hobbit. And I know I can't save Middle-Earth.
merry I just want to help my friends. Frodo. Sam. Pippin. More than anything… I wish I could see them again.

frodo Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
easterling I thought I'd lost you… so I took it. Only for safekeeping.
easterling Give it to me. Give me the ring, Sam.
frodo Sam! Give me the Ring.
frodo You must understand, the Ring is my burden. It will destroy you, Sam.
easterling Come on, Mister Frodo. We best find you some clothes. You can't go walking to Mordor in naught but your skin.
voice_of_the_ring We did it, Mister Frodo. We made it to Mordor.
gandalf There are so many of them. We'll never get through unseen!
gandalf It's Him! The Eye!
aragorn We have to go in there, Mister Frodo. There's nothing for it. Well, let's make it down the hill for starters, shall we?
gandalf The Return of the King
gandalf Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
gimli The darkness is deepening.
gandalf If Sauron had the Ring we would know it.
gandalf It's only a matter of time.
aragorn He has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of Mordor our enemy is regrouping.
aragorn Let him stay there. Let him rot! Why should we care?
gimli Because ten thousand Orcs now stand between Frodo and Mount Doom.
aragorn I've sent him to his death.
eomer No. There's still hope for Frodo. He needs time, and safe passage across the Plains of Gorgoroth.
aragorn We can give him that.
aragorn How?
legolas Draw out Sauron's armies. Empty his lands. Then we gather our full strength and march on the Black Gate.
gimli We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
gandalf Not for ourselves, but we can give Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.
aragorn Keep him blind to all else that moves.
aragorn A diversion.
aragorn Certainty of death. Small chance of success. What are we waiting for?
eowyn Sauron will suspect a trap. He will not take the bait.
faramir Oh, I think he will.
faramir Long have you hunted me. Long have I eluded you. No more.
madril Behold the sword of Elendil.

voice_of_the_ring Back in the line! You maggots! Back into the line, you slugs!
easterling Dig it, you slugs! Move it!
frodo I can't… I can't manage the Ring, Sam. It's… it's… it's such a weight to carry. It… such a weight.
easterling We're going that way. Straight as we can. There's no point in carrying anything we're not sure to need.
easterling Mister Frodo, look! There is light, and beauty up there, that no Shadow can touch.
easterling The Return of the King
pippin Take mine, there's a few drops left.
aragorn There'll be none left for the return journey.

pippin Where are they?
pippin Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth! Let justice be done upon him!
gandalf My master, Sauron the Great, bids you welcome. Is there any in this rout with the authority to treat with me?
merry We do not come to treat with Sauron, faithless and accursed. Tell your master this
gandalf Old Greybeard. I have a token I was bidden to show thee.
sauron Frodo.
sauron Frodo!
gimli Silence.
aragorn No!
aragorn Silence!
easterling The halfling was dear to thee, I see. Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host. Who would've thought one so small could endure so much pain? And he did, Gandalf. He did.
voice_of_the_ring And who is this? Isildur's heir? It takes more to make a king than a broken Elvish blade.
aragorn I guess that concludes negotiations.
aragorn I do not believe it. I will not.
aragorn Pull back! Pull back!
aragorn It's gone, Mister Frodo. The light's passed on, away towards the North. Something's drawn its gaze.
aragorn The Return of the King
gimli Hold your ground! Hold your ground.
legolas Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.
gimli A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends, and break all bonds of fellowship, but it is not this day.
easterling An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the Age of Men comes crashing down, but it is not this day! This day we fight!
easterling By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!
easterling Never thought I'd die fighting side by side with an elf.
frodo What about side by side with a friend?
frodo Aye, I could do that.
easterling Do you remember the Shire, Mister Frodo? It'll be spring soon, and the Orchards will be in blossom.
eowyn And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket and they'll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields.
aragorn And eating the first of the strawberries with cream. Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
voice_of_the_ring No, Sam, I can't recall the taste of food.
easterling Nor the sound of water. Or the touch of grass. I'm naked in the dark. There's nothing… no veil… between me and the wheel of fire! I can see him with my waking eyes!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Then let us be rid of it, once and for all! Come on, Mister Frodo. I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you! Come on!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Aragorn… Elessar…
frodo For Frodo.
frodo The Return of the King
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Look, Mister Frodo. A doorway! We're almost there.
easterling Clever Hobbits, to climb so high!
pippin Mustn't go that way! Mustn't hurt the precious!
easterling You swore! You swore on the precious!
frodo Sméagol promised!
easterling Sméagol lied.
easterling Frodo!
easterling Eagles! The Eagles are coming!
frodo Frodo!
easterling I'm here, Sam.
easterling Destroy it!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier Go on. Now! Throw it in the fire!
spearthrowing_rohan_soldier What are you waiting for? Just let it go!
easterling The Ring is mine!
easterling No. No!
easterling No!
easterling Yes! Yes!
merry Precious! Precious! Precious! Precious!
voice_of_the_ring Give me your hand!
frodo Take my hand!
easterling No! Don't you let go!
frodo Don't let go. Reach!
easterling Frodo! Frodo!
easterling The Return of the King
frodo It's gone. It's done.
frodo Yes, Mister Frodo. It's over now.
merry I can see the Shire… the Brandywine River… Bag End… Gandalf's fireworks… the lights in the Party Tree.
frodo Rosie Cotton dancing. She had ribbons in her hair. If ever I was to marry someone, it would've been her.
frodo It would've been her.
gandalf I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee, here at the end of all things.
aragorn Gandalf?
aragorn Frodo!
aragorn Gimli!
aragorn Aragorn.
voice_of_the_ring Now come the days of the king. May they be blessed.
frodo This day does not belong to one man but to all. Let us together rebuild this world… that we may share in the days of peace.
frodo Et Eärello Endorenna utúlien. Sinome maruvan ar Hildinyar tenn' Ambar-metta. (Out of the Great Sea to Middle-Earth I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.)
frodo Hannon le. (Thank you.)
rosie_cotton My friends! You bow to no one.
frodo The Return of the King
frodo And thus it was, the Fourth Age of Middle-Earth began, and the Fellowship of the Ring, though eternally bound by friendship and love, was ended.
easterling Thirteen months to the day, since Gandalf sent us on our long journey, we found ourselves looking upon a familiar site. We were home.
frodo Good night, Rosie.
easterling Good night, lads.
frodo How do you pick up the threads of an old life? How do you go on, when in your heart, you begin to understand, there is no going back?
frodo There are some things that time cannot mend. Some hurts that go too deep… that have taken hold.
bilbo Mister Frodo? What is it?
frodo It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam. It's never really healed.
bilbo 'There and Back again, a Hobbit's Tale by Bilbo Baggins'… and 'The Lord of the Rings by Frodo Baggins.' You finished it!
frodo Not quite. There's room for a little more.
bilbo Bilbo once told me, his part in this tale would end. That each of must come and go in the telling. Bilbo's story was now over. There would be no more journeys for him… save one.
bilbo Tell me again, lad, where are we going?
galadriel To the harbor, Uncle. The elves have accorded you a special honor. A place on the last ship to leave Middle-Earth.
goblin Frodo, any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again? Hmm? The one I gave you?
bilbo I'm sorry, Uncle… I'm afraid I lost it.
gandalf Oh, pity. I should like to have held it, one last time.
gandalf Oh! Here is a sight that I have never seen before.
gandalf The power of the three rings is ended. The time has come for the Dominion of Men.
gandalf I Aear can vên na mar. (The sea calls us home.)
easterling I think I'm quite ready for another adventure!
frodo Farewell… my brave hobbits. My work is now finished.
sam Here at last, on the shores of the sea, comes the end of our Fellowship.
frodo I will not say, do not weep, for not all tears are an evil.
frodo It is time, Frodo.
easterling What does he mean?

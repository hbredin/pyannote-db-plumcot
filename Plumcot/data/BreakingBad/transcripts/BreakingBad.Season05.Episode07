jesse_pinkman There. That's them.
mike_ehrmantraut Your play, Walter. You're on your own.
declan Looks like you're about 1000 gallons light here, Mike. Where's the juice?
walter_white The methylamine isn't coming.
declan Why's that? And who the hell are you?
walter_white I'm the man that is keeping it.
declan *to Mike* What the hell's this? We had an agreement, right. We had our deal, so where's the tank, Mike?
walter_white Mike doesn't know where it is, only I do. And you're dealing with me now, not him.
declan Why don't you just cut to what it is you want or what you think is gonna happen here, alright? Cause we're, we're gonna get what we came for.
walter_white 1000 gallons of methylamine is worth more in my hands than yours, or anyone else's, for that matter. But, I need distribution.
declan Distribution?
walter_white That's right. So if you agree to give up your cook and sell my product instead, I'll give you 35% of the take.
declan 35%, wow are you kidding me? Thirtyfive, Mike, please tell me this is a joke. You know how far we had to stick our necks out to get this cash? And why the hell would we want you? You realize we have our own operation, right?
walter_white I know all about your operation. See, my partners here tell me that you produce a meth that's 70% pure, if you're lucky. What I produce is 99.1% pure.
declan So?
walter_white So...it's gradeschool teeball versus the New York Yankees. Yours is just some tepid, offbrand, generic cola. What I'm making is classic Coke.
declan Alright. Okay, so um, if we just waste you right here, right now. Leave you in the desert, then there is no more Coke on the market, right? See how that works, there's only us.
walter_white Do you really wanna live in a world without CocaCola?
walter_white My partner tells me that your crew switched to a P2P cook because of our success. You dye your meth with food coloring to make it look like mine. You already ape my product at every turn. But now, you have the opportunity to sell it yourself.
declan I need you to listen to me. We're not gonna give up this deal to be your errand boys, do you understand? For what? To watch a bunch of junkies get a better high?
walter_white A better high means customers pay more. A higher purity means a greater yield. That's 130 million dollars of profit that isn't being pissed away by some substandard cook. Now you listen to me. You've got the greatest meth cook in Am no, the two greatest meth cooks in America right here, and with our skills you'll earn more from that 35% than you ever would on your own.
declan Yeah, that's what you say. I'm just wondering why we're so lucky. Why cut us in?
walter_white Mike is retiring from our crew, so his share of the partnership is available if you can handle his end. Distribution. And if you give him five million dollars of the fifteen million that you brought today. Just think of it as a finder's fee for bringing us together. We have forty pounds of product ready to ship. Ready to go. Are you ready?
declan Who the hell are you?
walter_white You know. You all know exactly who I am. Say my name.
declan What? I don't have a damn clue who the hell you are.
walter_white Yeah, you do. I'm the cook. I'm the man who killed Gus Fring.
declan Bullshit. Cartel got Fring.
walter_white Are you sure? That's right. Now. Say my name.
declan You're Heisenberg.
walter_white You're goddamn right.
mike_ehrmantraut I gotta hand it to you, Walter.
jesse_pinkman *to Walt* Hey. I appreciate the kind words, but I'm out too, remember?
walter_white I know, we'll talk.
jesse_pinkman Maybe we should talk about how and when I'm gonna get my five million dollars.
walter_white And we will do that. Absolutely.
jesse_pinkman It's just, you know, Mr. White
walter_white Jesse. Just give me some time here, okay? I'll need a little help getting things up and running during this transition, you can at least do that for me, right? Huh? Come on, don't worry, we'll figure it out.
mike_ehrmantraut Well, I guess that's it. Parting thoughts of which I have two. The first. As I said, I'll handle the legacy cost out of my end so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore. Second, the bug. The DEA will do a sweep. Can't say when, could be any time, but you need to get it out of there sooner rather than later. Alright.
walter_white That's it? No thanks for the five million dollars? No sorry for chaining you to a radiator?
mike_ehrmantraut Just get the bug, Walter.
jesse_pinkman So, hey. Guess I'll see you around.
mike_ehrmantraut Nope, don't think so. When I'm out, I'm out.
jesse_pinkman I'm out too, Mike.
mike_ehrmantraut *sighs* Kid, just look out for yourself.
walter_white Are we good?
skyler_white You tell me.
walter_white *to Jesse* Okay Jesse, back it up.
walter_white You're good. Keep it comin'. Straight back. Slow it down. Alright, that's good.
jesse_pinkman *to Skyler* Hey, Mrs. White.
jesse_pinkman Vamonos.
skyler_white I wish.
walter_white Alright, let's get this thing hooked up.
skyler_white Walt. What is this?
walter_white Do you really wanna know?
skyler_white Why are you hiding it here?
walter_white Don't worry about it
skyler_white Who are you hiding it from?
walter_white I said, don't worry about it.
skyler_white From the police? Or someone else? Someone who would kill for it?
walter_white Why don't you go back in the office? Why don't you go back in the office and let us do this. We'll get it out of your hair.
dorothy_yobs Oh, what'd you bring me this time?
dan_wachsberger They're bacon banana cookies.
dorothy_yobs Is there bacon in these? Oh my God.
dan_wachsberger Just bits, just little bits of bacon. Just enough to really make those suckers pop.
dorothy_yobs Dan, this is too much.
dorothy_yobs I'm not sharing those, I don't give a crap. They're mine.
dan_wachsberger Well, they're yours to do with as you please.
dorothy_yobs Good, cause my husband's not getting any, either.
dan_wachsberger How is Mickey?
dorothy_yobs Don't get me started. He wants to buy a boat. I can't even get him to start the lawnmower and he wants to buy a boat.
dan_wachsberger I don't know, a boat might be nice. Little one, maybe.
dorothy_yobs Where would you even take a boat? All the way down to Elephant Beach?
dan_wachsberger Or Caballo. It's beautiful down there. You could even leave it at the lake if you don't wanna haul it.
dorothy_yobs We're not buying a boat, I'll tell you that right now. And the last one is 545.
dan_wachsberger 569.
dorothy_yobs Aw dangit, almost got 'em all that time.
dan_wachsberger Very good, but actually I've got an extra one for you this week, 603.
dorothy_yobs 603, where is that?
dan_wachsberger Right down there.
dorothy_yobs Ah. Alright, I'll let you get to it.
dan_wachsberger Thanks, Dot.
dan_wachsberger Young Kaylee's gonna need a second safety deposit box if you decide to leave one more dollar to her.
mike_ehrmantraut How's the rest of it?
dan_wachsberger Oh, it's empty as usual. The families are pretty reliable with the pickups.
mike_ehrmantraut Nobody complaining about them wanting it all at once?
dan_wachsberger No, they get it, slow and steady wins the race. Well, I guess this is it for a while. Don't worry about the families, they'll keep getting their deliveries.
hank_schrader *through listening device* Yeah, I know times are tight, but it's for the kids and your sponsorship would sure be appreciated. Now we have a silver level, but the gold and platinum levels really get your name out there on the banners and tshirts. Sure, no that's not a problem, you call me directly if things change, ya hear? Uhh, Gomie! Take a brick to my head if I have to make another fun run call. I'm done! What's up? Why you smiling?
steven_gomez 'Cause the Erhmantraut warrant just came in.
hank_schrader Oh baby, now we're talkin'. How quick can you get your group together?
steven_gomez Two, maybe three hours.
hank_schrader Can we make it two? We're gonna nail that son of a bitch.
dea_agent_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season05.Episode07 Police! Search warrant!
dea_agent_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season05.Episode07 Police! Search warrant!
mike_ehrmantraut Coming, hold your horses.
dea_agent_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season05.Episode07 Search warrant. Police. Search warrant.
hank_schrader How's that restraining order workin' for ya?
mike_ehrmantraut Uh, if you want me to read that I'm gonna need my glasses.
walter_white Hey! Perfect timing, just about to get started. Uhh, you know, if you could get going on that settling tank that would be a huge help. We left that stuff in there after the last cook.
jesse_pinkman Mr. White.
walter_white I mean way too long, now we have tremendous amount of residue. You know what we need to invest in is a power washer.
jesse_pinkman Mr. White, could we just take a second and talk about all this?
walter_white Yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah.
walter_white Uh, look, you know what I think we need to talk about? Is doubling down.
jesse_pinkman Doubling down?
walter_white Mmhmm. Cooking 100 pounds a week, not fifty. As in, starting a lab, a lab that you'll run. A cook all of your own. Why not, you deserve it. You're every bit as good as me. Well, what do you think?
jesse_pinkman Mr. White, uh, I think that nothing has changed for me. I just want to get my money and get out.
walter_white Jesse. This...what we do. Being the best at something is a very rare thing, you don't just toss something like that away. And what, you wanna squander that potential, your potential? Why? To do what?
jesse_pinkman I don't know.
walter_white Well, think. To do what, Jesse.
jesse_pinkman I'll figure it out, alright?
walter_white Look at you. What have you got in your life, huh? Nothing. Nobody. Oh wait, yes, video games and gokarts. Oh, and when you get tired of that, what then? Huh? And how soon will you start using again? Look, look I know how upset you are about what happened to this boy. I am just as upset as you are.
jesse_pinkman Are you? Really?
walter_white How can you say that to me? Jesus. I mean, I'm the one who's the father here. What, do I have to curl up in a ball and tears in front of you? Do I have to lock myself up in a room and get high to prove it to you? What happened to that boy is a tragedy and it tears me up inside. But because it happened, what am I supposed to just lie down and die with him? It's done! It makes me sick that it happened just like everyone else who's died in our wake. What Todd did, you and I have done things that are just as bad.
jesse_pinkman Yeah.
walter_white All the people that we've killed. Gale. And the rest. If you believe that there's a hell, I don't know if you're into that, but we're...we're already pretty much going there, right? But I'm not gonna lie down until I get there.
jesse_pinkman What, just because I don't wanna cook meth anymore, I'm lying down? How many more people are gonna die because of us?
walter_white No one. None. Now that we're in control, no one else gets hurt.
jesse_pinkman You keep saying that and it's bullshit every time. Always. You know what? I'm done, okay. You just give me my money and you and I, we're done.
walter_white Okay. Why? Why do you want this money?
jesse_pinkman Because it's mine. It's my cut?
walter_white But isn't it filthy blood money? You're so pure, you have emotional depth. No, no, no, no, you shouldn't touch that dirty money. I'll save you from that, Jesse. Come on. You want it, you want it just as much as I want it. And it's not wrong to want it, okay? So stay and work with me and you can make ten times, twenty times as much.
jesse_pinkman Whatever, man. You don't wanna pay me, I don't care.
walter_white Yes, you do.
jesse_pinkman It's on you, alright? I'm done.
walter_white No you're not, you're not done. You're not leaving because if you leave, you get nothing! You understand me?! Nothing! Jesse!
sac_ramey Budget for the current fiscal year for electronic surveillance is 1.5 million. On par with ATF and the marshall service, that's still a fraction of FBI totals. Lobbying congress for an additional 1.41, but we're waiting on action reports to demonstrate that we're actually getting worthwhile results. *starts to fade into the background as Hank looks at images of Mike*
sac_ramey Hank! I think we're going to wrap this up. If ASAC Schrader can stay behind while everyone else clears out. Thank you, everybody.
sac_ramey You know no one wants to see you succeed at this more than me, right?
hank_schrader Yes sir.
sac_ramey I know how good you are, I wouldn't have stuck my neck out to get you here if I didn't. But you're not knocking down doors anymore, bubba. You're in charge of an entire district office and that comes with responsibilities. I mean, Hank. Basic reports aren't being filed in a timely manner.
hank_schrader I'll work on it, it'll get better.
sac_ramey Yeah it will, because way too much time and money is being spent on the Fring case, a case which is essentially over. All this overtime to surveil Michael Ehrmantraut? That's just money that can be better spent elsewhere.
hank_schrader I understand, but I'm not making these choices lightly. We've got increased reports of blue meth out on the streets, Fring's gang is still operational and Ehrmantraut is involved. It's that simple.
sac_ramey I believe you. But so what. It's one case out of dozens and you don't play favorites with it just because it used to be yours.
hank_schrader No, I really...
sac_ramey Don't play favorites with it, Hank. You've got a bigger job than that. I mean, forget the financial costs, I hear you're personally serving search warrants out in the field?
hank_schrader That was an error in judgement. Won't happen again.
sac_ramey You're damn right it won't! I'm just gonna bottomline it for you. The surveillance budget for Ehrmantraut is now zero. We clear?
hank_schrader Sure. Thank you. Clear.
sac_ramey Good. We'll be in touch.
hank_schrader Yeah.
steven_gomez Hey.
steven_gomez So, Ramey wanted to catch up with you? Talk sports and stuff, I guess?
hank_schrader Yeah, something like that. No more following Ehrmantraut. He's not worth the financial investment.
steven_gomez Well, it's not like the guy is going anywhere. He's not even bothering to throw our tails anymore. He's just living a boring old man life like he has nothing left to hide.
hank_schrader And none of Fring's crew is talking?
steven_gomez Not giving an inch.
hank_schrader Sweeten the pot enough? Zero jail time and an allexpensepaid trip to Maui?
steven_gomez Not that, but close. Nobody wants to bite.
hank_schrader Christ. They're either the most loyal crew in history or someone's still paying them off. You still checking bank records?
steven_gomez No one living beyond their means.
hank_schrader But nine perps all being represented by one lawyer.
steven_gomez Not unusual in a case like this.
hank_schrader Yeah, this guy, what's his name? Daniel Wachsberger? He represents every one of these douchebags except for Ehrmantraut. Can we find out more about the lawyer?
steven_gomez You want me to start tailing a lawyer? Like the shit ain't deep enough for you already?
hank_schrader Hey, Ramey said we couldn't follow Ehrmantraut, he didn't say anything about anyone else. Do it.
steven_gomez You're the boss.
walter_white Alright, should we get started? Now, I know that most of this, or all of this, is gonna be new to you. Did you take chemistry in high school? Just basic.
todd No.
walter_white Okay, it's alright. Now, as we go, I'll be as detailed as possible without being overwhelming.
todd Yes sir.
walter_white Look, Todd, I don't need you to be Antoine Lavoisier. Umm, what I do need is your full effort and attention. Listen and apply yourself. If you do that then we just might have a fighting chance here, okay?
walter_white Okay.
todd Okay.
walter_white Meth, here we go.
walter_white Now, the CO2 freezes the liquid, crystallizing it. Which gives us our finished methamphetamine. Now, all that's left is to break it up, weigh it, and we're done.
todd Wow, this is, umm...this is complicated, it's gonna take me a few more times to get a grasp on...
walter_white Oh yeah. It'll take a few more times.
todd I do alright?
walter_white You did fine, Todd. You applied yourself, that's as much as I can ask. Now, all that's left I guess is talk money.
todd We can talk money once I get this right.
dan_wachsberger Morning. Guess what I have. Cake pops. They're balls of cake on a stick.
dorothy_yobs Very nice, thank you, Dan.
dan_wachsberger See, I put little faces on them.
dan_wachsberger Hey.
steven_gomez Hey.
walter_white Alright. You know I'm working with a new guy now. I think that, I think it could possibly work out, because...
walter_white I'm trying, Hank, I'm really trying. But there's, there's...I mean, it's like I don't even exist to her.
walter_white I mean, I know she's struggling, I know. But I, I just don't know what to do, I mean, what can I do? Such a mess. I mean, both of us, we just have screwed up so much. I'm sorry, I don't, do you have any coffee, maybe I can...
hank_schrader Coffee, you bet. You bet. What you take, uh, cream?
walter_white Yeah.
hank_schrader Alright, here you go, buddy.
walter_white Oh, thank you, Hank. Look, I'm sorry to waste your time with all this, it's really...
hank_schrader Well, you know, it's, you know.
steven_gomez Hey.
walter_white Oh, hey.
hank_schrader Hey, could you excuse me.
hank_schrader Tell me something good.
steven_gomez You tell me. We've been sweating the guy for fourteen hours, that should be some kind of record.
hank_schrader Yeah, quit your bragging, what'd you get?
steven_gomez He's gonna do it. He's gonna flip.
hank_schrader He's willing to give us Ehrmantraut?
hank_schrader What are you wasting your time for? Throw a net around that son of a bitch.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah.
dan_wachsberger Mike, hey, it's me, can you talk?
mike_ehrmantraut I can.
dan_wachsberger Great. Look, there's a small situation with the money. I don't wanna do this on the phone, are you available?
mike_ehrmantraut I can come by in a few hours.
dan_wachsberger That's not good for me, where are you now?
mike_ehrmantraut I'm at the park with my granddaughter.
dan_wachsberger Where exactly?
mike_ehrmantraut Pollemeda.
dan_wachsberger Oh, you know what? I'm not far. I'll come to you, you just hang tight.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah.
walter_white Mike, they're coming for you. Right now, they're coming.
mike_ehrmantraut Slow down Walter, who?
walter_white The DEA. The DEA, somebody flipped. They have, uh, some kind of bank surveillance and something about some lawyer. Someone's talking, Mike, and they're coming for you right now.
saul_goodman How could Mike use that clown of a lawyer, Dan Wachsberger? He would've had better luck with the firm of O'Larry and Shemp. Always consult with me before using outside counsel.
walter_white Alright, alright, Saul. Enough. Please. Instead of just sitting around here, what can we do?
saul_goodman Besides pray that he gets away? I'm open to ideas. Because if the DEA catches up with him and he flips? It's goodnight John boy.
jesse_pinkman No. No way Mike would ever flip, okay? No way.
saul_goodman Yeah, yeah. Never say never. Okay, this is the second time the DEA has confiscated his bank roll. You know? Jesus, fool me once, right?
jesse_pinkman Look, he won't flip!
walter_white But his nine guys will.
saul_goodman Hey. Woah, woah. *to Walt* It's him.
saul_goodman Mike, I got you on speakerphone with the brain trust.
mike_ehrmantraut The what?
saul_goodman Walt and Jesse are here.
mike_ehrmantraut I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul, I want you. I need your help.
jesse_pinkman Hey, what do you need?
mike_ehrmantraut I got a go bag at the airport. Passports, money. But there are eyes everywhere, I can't get close. I need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible.
saul_goodman You know how thick the crap storm is out there because of this? I told you not to use that lawyer, he's a hack.
mike_ehrmantraut Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.
jesse_pinkman Hey, Mike, I can get it for you, just tell me what to do.
mike_ehrmantraut No, kid. Not you. I'm paying Saul, he can do the job just fine.
saul_goodman Yeah, you're paying me and the DEA knows I represent you so they're probably sitting at my car right now hoping I do something stupid.
jesse_pinkman Mike, I can do it, it's not a problem.
mike_ehrmantraut No, Jesse.
walter_white Jesus, I'll do it. *to Jesse* Besides, you're out, remember? Mike, tell me where to get this bag.
mike_ehrmantraut Hello, Walter.
walter_white Before I hand this over, I need something from you.
mike_ehrmantraut And what's that?
walter_white The names of your nine men.
mike_ehrmantraut Why? You're never gonna pay them off, what's the point?
walter_white The point is, Mike, it affects me. It affects Jesse too, and we, we deserve to know.
mike_ehrmantraut The only thing left to do now is leave town, do you understand?
walter_white Leave town, wow. Yeah, I just can't up and leave like you, Mike. I've got a family, I've got people who depend on me.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah. *walks up to Walt and takes the bag from him* Goodbye, Walter.
walter_white You're welcome.
mike_ehrmantraut I'm sorry. What?
walter_white I want those names, Mike. You owe me that much.
mike_ehrmantraut I don't owe you a damn thing. All of this, falling apart like this, is on you.
walter_white Wow. Wow! Oh that's some kind of logic right there, Mike. You screw up, get yourself followed by the DEA, and now suddenly this is all my fault? Why don't you walk me through this, Mike.
mike_ehrmantraut We had a good thing, you stupid son of a bitch. We had Fring. We had a lab. We had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork. You could've shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed. It was perfect. But no. You just had to blow it up. You. And your pride and your ego. You just had to be the man. If you'd done your job, known your place, we'd all be fine right now.
walter_white I just...I just realized that Lydia has the names, I can get 'em from her. I'm sorry Mike. This, this whole thing could've been avoided.
mike_ehrmantraut Shut the fuck up. And let me die in peace.

walter_white_jr So if it's okay, I was thinking about using this one for the test? Mom's brakes are very sticky and you barely press down on them and it's like screech.
walter_white Sure.
walter_white_jr But, I'm good?
walter_white Yeah, you're great. Why?
walter_white_jr Umm, are my feet okay?
walter_white Uhh...
walter_white_jr I looked it up. It basically says all I need is a note from my doctor. I know it's not the right way and all, but once I get my provisional I can keep working at it.
walter_white Well, as long as it gets you safely from point A to point B then who am I to argue.
skyler_white Hi. You're a sweet girl, yes you are. Yes you are, yes you are. I know.
walter_white Here you go.
walter_white_jr Here you go. Thank you.
walter_white Got it?
walter_white_jr Yeah.
walter_white Okay.
walter_white_jr So, 9 A.M. Saturday.
walter_white Yes, 9 A.M. Saturday.
walter_white_jr So which means pick me up around 830?
walter_white I'll be here with bells on.
walter_white_jr What?
walter_white I'm just...a saying. Don't worry, I won't be wearing bells.
skyler_white Hey.
walter_white_jr Hey, Mom.
skyler_white Hi, umm, do you have a minute.
walter_white Yeah.
skyler_white *to Junior* Could you go inside and keep an eye on your sister for a minute?
walter_white_jr Yeah sure. See ya, Dad.
walter_white Bye, son. Hey, good work today.
walter_white_jr Thank you.
skyler_white Have you thought any more of what we discussed?
walter_white Thought any more, meaning reconsidered? No.
skyler_white So show me the flaw in it.
walter_white Uh, flaws, Skyler. Flaws. Plural, not singular. Where do you want me to start?
skyler_white Hey, I don't love this situation, alright? That you put me in. However let's just stick with what makes sense here. You took the seed money you won gambling, you invested it in the carwash that you helped run for four years. You hired your wife as a bookkeeper because, guess what. She's actually a bookkeeper. Now that is a story an auditor can believe, so what am I missing?
walter_white You're missing that you should just take this money that I give you and not look too closely at it, so if, God forbid, I get caught, you maintain plausible deniability.
skyler_white Okay, my estranged husband, who when he was working made $43,000 a year, started shoveling money at me and when the police come I'm supposed to just say, "Gee, umm, I never thought about it officer, made sense to me." Really? That in your mind is plausible deniability? I'll tell you what, Walt. I'd rather have them think I'm Bonnie what'shername than some complete idiot.
walter_white So you're promoting caution here? And you want a believable story?
skyler_white That, it seems to me, is the safest way to make the best out of a very bad situation, yes.
walter_white Ah. But I am noting a little hole in your plot, though. Why would your estranged husband be doing all this for you?
skyler_white Because he loves his family and desperately wants a reconciliation though it may be hopeless and futile. Then again, he'd try anything.
walter_white I'm just not buying it. You know, I think it would be better if the husband were no longer estranged. Maybe if he were back sleeping in his own bed?
skyler_white Wow. It's suddenly a fantasy story.
walter_white I am at least going to be a part of this household. Dinner with the family every night of the week.
skyler_white Not every night, no.
walter_white Six nights a week, you get one night off.
skyler_white Dinner two nights, not weekends, with twentyfour hours notice.
walter_white Five nights a week with no notice.
skyler_white Three. Six hours notice.
walter_white Five nights a week with two hours notice.
skyler_white Four. Don't push it.
walter_white And I want my own key to the house.
skyler_white No.
walter_white For emergencies and appearances, yes. I am going to babysit my own daughter, I am going to help my son with his homework. I am going to be a part of this family and that is how we'll sell your little fiction.
jesse_pinkman How about we stop somewhere afterward and get a beer.
walter_white Umm, no thanks but no, maybe some other time.
jesse_pinkman Seriously. Get a beer with me.
walter_white What?
walter_white What the hell are you doing?
jesse_pinkman It's ours, right? Look at it and tell me if that's ours.
walter_white Yes it's ours, now put it away. What the hell is wrong with you? Where did you get that, did you take it from the lab?
jesse_pinkman I bought it from the two guys who killed Combo. They had Combo shot down in the streets and now it's our product they're selling. Which means they work from our guy, right?
walter_white What is that? That's hearsay. Do you have any proof?
jesse_pinkman I heard it from the sister of the kid who shot him. Hear how I just said kid. This kid, he's eleven years old, shot Combo on orders. These two scumbags, they got him dealing. They got him...and you know he's not the first. They use kids because, hey, why not? Easy to control, easy to fool. All they get is juvie if they ever get caught. Hearts and minds, right? Get 'em young and they're yours forever. These guys killed Combo. They used this little kid like some puppet. They used him to shoot my friend.
walter_white So why are you telling me this?
jesse_pinkman I need your help.
walter_white How?
jesse_pinkman I need ricin.
walter_white Oh my God. Oh God.
jesse_pinkman Look these two, hey
walter_white No.
jesse_pinkman Hey, they gotta go, alright? I got the entire thing figured out. The delivery method, everything. All I need from you is the poison. That's all.
walter_white No.
jesse_pinkman Look. Otherwise, you don't gotta lift a finger.
walter_white No. Listen, you don't even know what you're talking about. How do you even
jesse_pinkman Look, you don't get how right this is? You don't get how the whole entire world would be better off?
walter_white You know, we're not even talking about this.
jesse_pinkman I know a woman who buys from these two once or twice a week, alright? She brings them hamburgers because they get hungry so she brings them food and they knock a few bucks off her price. There's your delivery system right there. I could be a mile away.
walter_white Jesus. A meth head? You're trusting to do this?
jesse_pinkman You know what, that meth head stood up to your brotherinlaw, alright? He questioned her for five hours, she didn't give it up. You know how it is you know it? Cause you're not in prison right now.
walter_white Yeah well I know I would be in prison after this. Prison or worse. And I'd be right alongside you. No, Jesse you cannot be serious. This...this is a ridiculous idea.
jesse_pinkman Ridiculous? What so you're saying it's not gonna work? How about back when it was your plan? Back when we were gonna use it on Tuco?
walter_white Apples and oranges.
jesse_pinkman A guy eats ricin, two or three days later he gets the flu. Or a heart attack or something and he kneels over, that's what you said. Untraceable back to us. To me. Not even that other scumbag we work for is gonna find out. Yo, it was a good plan back when it was Tuco and it's a good plan now.
walter_white Tuco wanted to murder us. These guys don't. Apples and oranges. Do I really have to sit here and explain the difference to you?
jesse_pinkman Combo was us, man. He was one of us. Does that mean nothing?
walter_white Why didn't you go after these guys two or three months ago?
jesse_pinkman Cause I just found out about them.
walter_white What's to find out? It's a dispute over turf, right, I mean how hard could it have been for you to track them down on their turf and kill them months ago? Because back then you were too busy getting high, feeling sorry. No, murder is not part of your twelvestep program. This is not some amends you have to make. What you are talking about here is pointless. This achieves nothing. It accomplishes nothing.
jesse_pinkman If you're not seeing what it accomplishes, there's no way I can explain it to you.
walter_white Jesse, listen to me. You are not a murderer. I am not and you are not. It's as simple as that.
walter_white Jesse.
jesse_pinkman I'm doing it. With or without you.
marie_schrader Knock, knock.
hank_schrader For Christ's sake Marie, you don't say knock knock. You *knocks on table* like that.
marie_schrader Well, I like saying it.
hank_schrader Yeah well, that's not the rules. *knocks on table* Okay?
marie_schrader Listen you knock your way, groucho, I'll knock mine. But look, see, I win.
walter_white_jr Not so fast.
hank_schrader Christ, again? That's three in a row. Got fricken Paul Newman over here?
marie_schrader Have you been playing cards with your dad?
walter_white_jr No, why?
hank_schrader How is your old man? He back teaching?
walter_white_jr No, uh, I don't think either of them are working right now.
hank_schrader Yeah, how they swinging that?
walter_white_jr I don't know.
marie_schrader Hey. Did you know that the doctor has told Uncle Hank that he can get out of here any time he wants to.
walter_white_jr Oh yeah? That's great.
hank_schrader Well, I'm not so sure about that.
walter_white_jr Why not?
marie_schrader What? That's what they said.
hank_schrader That's what they said because they want the room. Hit the sheets with Lysol, reset the meter, and wheel the next slob in here. We went over this, Marie. Drop it.
walter_white_jr Are you not well enough?
hank_schrader Jesus, kid, you too? Do I look well enough? I'm shitting in pans, peeing in pitchers. Can't move my legs, got it?
walter_white_jr So people in wheelchairs should be in hospitals? What about people on crutches? Maybe I should be in here too. Is that what you're trying to say?
hank_schrader Yeah that's exactly what I'm saying, deal you little prick.
saul_goodman Son of a bitch. *to Walt* You know I'm hourly, right?
walter_white He promised me that he would be here.
saul_goodman Oh, he promised. Why didn't you tell me? Let's wait then. That's a joke, the kid ain't comin'. Okay so, what's plan B?
walter_white I don't know. I really don't.
saul_goodman Well, let's brainstorm. You really think he's serious?
walter_white That's why I'm here, Saul. The way he was talking, he is going to do it. Or, try at least.
saul_goodman Okay so, we pay him off.
walter_white No, no, it's not about money. It's about getting him off the streets. Getting him to calm down. Maybe...what if we, uh, maybe, could you get him arrested?
saul_goodman *laughs* You want your criminal associate taken into police custody?
walter_white No, listen, I know it sounds risky, but it wouldn't be anything that could get him into real trouble and nothing that could lead back to our business. Just some minor offense.
saul_goodman Pinkman in jail, I don't know. I'm picturing it.
walter_white No, not jail as in jail jail. I'm talking about one of those situations where you're in an orange jumpsuit picking up litter along the highway.
saul_goodman That's jail. You're talking about a level two joint.
walter_white Something that keeps him off the street for say, thirty days. Then by the time he gets out, tempers have cooled and hopefully we can move on.
saul_goodman Well, Roswell Correctional's pretty low impact. In the past I've recommended Springer, but hearing chancy things about their bathrooms since they renovated. So.
walter_white So it's possible, right?
saul_goodman Yeah. Well, it falls under my premium services package, but you can afford that. I'll call my P.I.
jesse_pinkman You understand what you have to do? And you can never talk to anyone, right? I mean ever, understand?
wendy Yeah.
jesse_pinkman So I found this stuff on the Internet. Takes days to kick in. Just keep quiet and this will never come back to you. You're okay with this, right? Just think of it like it's the same thing as always, you're just delivering some of your burgers.
wendy It's not just delivering hamburgers.
jesse_pinkman Hey, you got a kid right? What's his name?
wendy Patrick.
jesse_pinkman Imagine these two guys had Patrick working as a mule. Making him kill people. Wouldn't you do anything to protect your kid?
wendy Of course I would. I'd do all kinds of things for him.
jesse_pinkman Okay. So. These guys, using kids like that, they gotta go. Right?
jesse_pinkman Good. Tomorrow we'll be in touch.
walter_white *to Holly* Yeah, I bet that tastes good.
walter_white What are you doing? If you need to talk, use the phone.
mike_ehrmantraut This isn't a phone talk, Walter. Your wife's out, right?
mike_ehrmantraut Oh *laughs* well isn't she something. I got a granddaughter a few years older.
walter_white What can I do for you?
mike_ehrmantraut Oh, have a seat Walter. I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman and this plan of yours.
walter_white And?
mike_ehrmantraut I'm not gonna do it.
walter_white Why?
mike_ehrmantraut Because it's moronic.
walter_white Saul said you've done things like this before.
mike_ehrmantraut That's not the moronic part.
walter_white Okay so, what's the problem?
mike_ehrmantraut The problem is the boss wouldn't like it.
walter_white Saul?
mike_ehrmantraut My boss. Your boss. This is a professional courtesy. No one knows I'm here, understand? But our employer would find out as always. And if Pinkman were arrested he'd take it as a problem. Walt, you got a good thing going here, we all do. You wanna risk it all on one junkie? Now I realize you two have a history, but this kid's been on the bubble for a while now. It's a long time coming.
walter_white What is?
mike_ehrmantraut *laughs* Ummm...I used to be a beat cop long time ago. And I'd get called out on domestic disputes all the time, hundreds probably over the years. But there was this one guy, this one piece of shit I will never forget Gordy. He looked like Bo Svenson, you remember him? Walking Tall? You don't remember?
walter_white No.
mike_ehrmantraut Anyway. Big boy. 270, 280, but his wife. Or whatever, she was his lady. Was real small, like a bird, wrists like little branches. Anyway, my partner and I get called out there every weekend and one of us would pull her aside and say, "Come on, tonight's the night we press charges." And this wasn't one of those deep down he really loves me setups, we got a lot of those, but not this. This girl was scared. She wasn't gonna cross him, no way, no how. Nothing we could do, but pass her off to the EMTs, put him in the car, drive him downtown, throw him in the drunk tank. He sleeps it off, next morning out he goes, back home. And one night, my partner's out sick and it's just me. And the call comes in and it's the usual crap, broke her nose in the shower kind of thing. So I cuff him, put him in the car and away we go. Only that night, we're driving into town and this sideways asshole is in my backseat humming Danny Boy and it just rubbed me wrong. So instead of left, I go right out into nowhere. And I kneel him down and I put my revolver in his mouth and I told him, this is it. This is how it ends. And he's crying, going to the bathroom all over himself, swearing to God he's gonna leave her alone, screaming. As much as you can with a gun in your mouth. And I told him be quiet because I needed to think about what I was gonna do here. He goes still. Then real quiet, like a dog waiting for dinner scraps. Then we just stood there for a while. Me acting like I was thinking things over, and Prince Charming kneeling in the dirt with shit in his pants. And after a few minutes I took the gun out of his mouth and I say, "So help me if you ever touch her again I will such and such and such and such and blah blah blah blah blah."
walter_white It was just a warning?
mike_ehrmantraut Of course. Just trying to do the right thing. But two weeks later he killed her, of course. Caved her head in with the base of a Waring blender. We got there there was so much blood you could taste the metal. Hm. The moral of the story is, I chose a half measure. When I should've gone all the way. I'll never make that mistake again. No more half measures, Walter.
jesse_pinkman Man, I don't get this. I don't get this at all. All I'm seein' is the kid. So where are they?
wendy I don't know. They're always around.
jesse_pinkman Burgers are getting cold.
wendy So, is it like, fast.
jesse_pinkman Don't sweat it, alright. You're just doing what you do. Okay, nobody's gonna know anything.
wendy Can I have another bump?
jesse_pinkman You had your bump, alright? We get this thing done then you can have all you want.
mike_ehrmantraut I'm gonna need you to come with me.
victor *to Wendy* Take a walk.
jesse_pinkman Where are we going?
gustavo_fring Sit down. I understand that you have a problem with two of my employees. It is true that they killed one of your associates. It is possible that they acted irrationally, but on the other hand there was provocation. A man was selling in their territory. There is blame on both sides. This will go no further. It will be settled right here, right now.
jesse_pinkman *to Walt* You told him.
gustavo_fring *to two drug dealers* Wait outside. *to Jesse* Listen to me. You have one friend in this room. This man. Those men outside are my trusted employees and when I learned what you intended to do. If it wasn't for this man and the respect that I have for him I would be dealing with this in a very different way. Don't look at him, look at me. This is what happens now. My men will come back inside and you will shake their hands and you will make peace and that will be the end of this.
jesse_pinkman No.
walter_white Jesse.
jesse_pinkman They used kids. These assholes they got an eleven year old kid doing their killing for them. You're supposed to be some kind of reasonable business man? This how you do business? *to Walt* You okay with this? You got anything to say here?
gustavo_fring *to Mike* Bring them back.
gustavo_fring *to two drug dealers* No more children. Understand? *to Jesse* And you. You keep the peace.
gustavo_fring Say it.
jesse_pinkman Yeah. I'll keep the peace.
gustavo_fring Shake hands.
walter_white Jesse, your actions. They affect other people. Sometimes, compromises have to be made for the best of reasons.
walter_white Jesse. Jesse!
hank_schrader Marie. Let the people who get paid to do this do this.
marie_schrader The people who get paid to do this do a lousy job.
marie_schrader So I guess this is what you want, huh? Just lying in a hospital bed, getting sponge baths from nurses.
hank_schrader Marie.
marie_schrader It's time to go home, Hank.
hank_schrader How many times I gotta tell you, Marie? Not 'til I'm well.
hank_schrader Heyheyheyheyhey, what are you doing?
marie_schrader I'm just seeing.
hank_schrader Seeing what?
marie_schrader What I see.
hank_schrader I'm not at my best here, Marie.
marie_schrader We'll see.
hank_schrader Nothing's going to happen.
marie_schrader I say it will.
hank_schrader Nah, I'm in this bed for a reason. It's a waste of time. Besides, what if someone comes in?
marie_schrader Let 'em, I don't care if someone walks in.
hank_schrader Marie, what's wrong with you?
marie_schrader I tell you what. If I can get the groundhog to see his shadow
hank_schrader It's not gonna happen, I'm sorry.
marie_schrader I'm betting it will. And if he does, you check out of here.
hank_schrader *laughs* I'm not gonna bet on whether I can get a boner. It's no bet. No bet here, no bet.
marie_schrader You afraid you'll lose?
hank_schrader You know what? You're just...you're just being foolish. Come on. What's the point?
marie_schrader The point is, you're not completely hopeless. We have a bet?
hank_schrader You know what? If it'll get you out of here quicker. You've got one minute.
marie_schrader One minute? Alright that's a cake walk.
hank_schrader Yeah, it's just. It's just sad I mean, I really feel sorry for you Marie I really do. It's just, uh, it's just *laughs* pathetic.
marie_schrader That's good, keep talking. Protest. Struggle.
hank_schrader Marie, give up, I mean, seriously it's...not...gonna happen.
andrea_cantillo Bad day?
jesse_pinkman I don't even know. Anyway. It's better now.
jesse_pinkman Tell 'em you're busy.
andrea_cantillo Hello. Grandma? Slow down. Slow down I can't...oh God. Oh God! *begins to cry* Oh God.
jesse_pinkman *on answering machine* Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
walter_white Jesse. You are now fortytwo minutes late. I'm starting without you.

skyler_white Okay.
jesse_pinkman *on answering machine* Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
jesse_pinkman *on answering machine* Hey, it's me. Wait for the thing.
walter_white Look I hope you're not waiting for an apology because I did not rat you out. I was looking out for your best interest as well as my own and I stand by my decision 100% so we'll just have to agree to disagree. Anyway, just call me back.
reporter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode12 ...surprised today as temperatures dropped below forty. Coming up the sevenday forecast suggests this might just be the beginning of an early cold snap.
skyler_white *to Junior* So the TV turns itself off, huh?
walter_white_jr Yeah.
walter_white I'll get it.
reporter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode12 But first, more details on our top story the murder of a young boy in the south valley. Police have yet to release a statement, but sources have indicated that eleven year old Tomas Cantillo may have been the victim of a gangrelated execution. An anonymous tip brought police to a playground in the 4700 block of Eighth Avenue last night. Paramedics were called to the scene, but were unable to revive the boy. A gruesome crime
skyler_white *to Walt* Can you turn that off?
reporter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode12 a shocking loss, and yet another casualty in the city's ongoing struggle against drugs
skyler_white Walt?
reporter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode12 and the gangs that peddle them. We'll be passing along details
skyler_white I'm sorry, it's just they've been talking about that all day and it's just.
walter_white Oh, yeah.
skyler_white *to Junior* Hey, uh, did you know your dad and I are thinking about maybe starting a business together?
walter_white_jr Seriously? What kind of business?
skyler_white Umm, we're thinking maybe a car wash.
walter_white_jr What do you mean, like...*fades into background*
walter_white I'm sorry, I have to go.
walter_white Run.

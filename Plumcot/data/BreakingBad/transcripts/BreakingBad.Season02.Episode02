jesse_pinkman Oh What, I can talk now?
walter_white Be good to me.
jesse_pinkman Yes, Yeah!
skyler_white Honey?
walter_white You wanna hear something funny? We had a faculty meeting last Thursday and the topic was senior class photos, and how we had instituted a new rule last year that seniors are allowed to have photos taken by a photographer of their choice, Not necessarily the photographer that the school hires, right? So Anyway, some of the senior girls were going to that Glamour Shots place, to have their photos taken, and now they're bringing us all these photos, and Joan Epperman, you know Joan, suddenly has to go through all these photos and turn them down, because they show cleavage.
skyler_white Did you get enough pancakes, sweetie?
walter_white_jr Yeah. I'm good.
walter_white You know, even these smallbusted girls have cleavage.
walter_white_jr The Wonderbra It's the Wonderbra.
voicemail#unknown#BreakingBad.Season02.Episode02 Hey, there.
jesse_pinkman Hello, Mr. White. This is AT&T calling.
walter_white This is Walter White speaking.
walter_white You said he was practically dead, okay? You said he would die any minute! Listen, I am having breakfast with my family right now, and I really don't appreciate these sales calls.
jesse_pinkman Well, too bad, man, 'cause guess what. He's still not dead!
walter_white Calm down, damn it.
jesse_pinkman Are you gonna help me clean this up? We got loose ends here!
walter_white Calm down! I will be there after school.
jesse_pinkman After school? Are you shitting me?
walter_white Listen, that is just not going to work for me.
skyler_white You have a good day, sweetie.
skyler_white Bye, honey. Drive safe.
walter_white Okay.
jesse_pinkman Oh, no, no Not good.
walter_white Oh, God! MILF's? What the hell is a MILF?
jesse_pinkman Now what?
walter_white The other one, out in the RV, he's You're sure?
jesse_pinkman Yes.
walter_white You're Positive?
jesse_pinkman Feel free to go check it yourself.
walter_white Yes, good idea. Maybe I should do that before he, too, wanders off on the damn street! J
jesse_pinkman Okay, you know what, I
walter_white All right, all right! The one downstairs, tell me about him.Come on, anything, something!
walter_white Start with his name, at least!
jesse_pinkman Krazy8.
walter_white Krazy8? What the hell does that even mean?
jesse_pinkman I don't know, man, okay? I mean, he's like, Krazy8, okay? I don't know.
walter_white So, you work with him regularly?
jesse_pinkman No, not him so much. His cousin, mainly.
walter_white Who's his cousin?
jesse_pinkman The guy out in the RV!
walter_white All right, all right.
jesse_pinkman Krazy8's one level higher.
walter_white One level higher?
jesse_pinkman Yeah, you know, not like street level. Higher.
jesse_pinkman You know, there's like a Starbucks at every corner?
walter_white Okay, so he's a distributor.
walter_white Okay, so, is he I mean, is he, In other words,
jesse_pinkman Well, um, He did try to kill us both yesterday,
walter_white What I'm trying to say is that he's a distributor, right? He's a He's a businessman, he's a man of business.
jesse_pinkman What?
walter_white Do you think he is capable of listening to reason?
jesse_pinkman Like "Dear Krazy8, listen, "if I let you go, will you promise not to come back and waste my family? "No Colombian neckties."
jesse_pinkman What was that? What was what? Come see! We gotta tie him up. Why the hell didn't we tie him up?
walter_white Because he was out cold.
jesse_pinkman But what if he's faking it? Like if it was me, I'd be all faking being knocked out, yo! And then, when the coast is clear, I'd be up looking for weapons and shit, waiting to pounce! Now if it was me, and I couldn't find a decent enough weapon, I would just lie back down, and bide my time.
jesse_pinkman So now what do we do?
walter_white You keep asking me that like you think I have some answer.
jesse_pinkman Well, you gotta do something!
walter_white We! We have got to do something, and I am opened to suggestions.
jesse_pinkman Man, uhuh, okay, this whole thing was your deal!
walter_white Don't you dare put that on me! You brought those guys out there, this is your responsibility!
jesse_pinkman Like I came to you, begging to cook meth.
jesse_pinkman What about the the phosphate gas? Phosphine gas.
walter_white What about it?
jesse_pinkman I mean, do you think it still might kill him? You know, with like a delayed reaction or something?
walter_white I don't know.
walter_white Look! This isn't even the issue that demands immediate attention. We have got a body in that RV, and it's getting warmer outside, understand? And we have got to do something about that soon. And in a way that no one will ever find it. Now that last part is very, very important.
jesse_pinkman Oh man, that's messed up.
walter_white I guess we'll both do it together.
jesse_pinkman No, Mr.White, okay, I'm not good with dead bodies.
walter_white We're in this 50/50, okay? I guess the only other fair way to go about this would be that one of us deals with the body situation, while the other one of us deals with the Krazy8 situation.
walter_white In a scenario like this, I don't suppose it is bad form to just flip a coin.
walter_white Heads or tails?
jesse_pinkman Heads.
walter_white Best two out of three?
walter_white Yes?
jesse_pinkman What kind of plastic, man?
walter_white Polyethylene.
jesse_pinkman How the hell am I supposed to know that?
walter_white Because I told you.
jesse_pinkman Yeah, yeah, LDPE. Right on, got it.
walter_white Not hydrofluoric.
jesse_pinkman Why not?
walter_white Look, you skipped, clowned around or otherwise jerked off to every lecture I ever gave. As far as I'm concerned, your chemistry education is over.
jesse_pinkman Oh, okay. Be a dick about it.
walter_white Yeah, I'm working up to it.
jesse_pinkman You know what? I bet he doesn't even wake up.
walter_whitekrazy_8 Who's there? Don't you fucking play games with me.
krazy_8 What are you gonna do? Hey, hey, I need water! Bring me some water, would you? Please?
walter_white You don't like the crust?
krazy_8 Where's my cousin Emilio? He dead?
jesse_pinkman Hey, Mr.White! Mr. White? Are you smoking weed?
walter_white So what did you end up buying?
jesse_pinkman Nothing. No store in town sells a plastic bin big enough for a body.
walter_white I don't suppose you could buy two bins Legs in one, torso in the other? God.
jesse_pinkman I don't suppose you could kiss my ass?
jesse_pinkman So, uh How did it go?
jesse_pinkman So you didn't do it?
walter_white Not yet.
jesse_pinkman God.
walter_white Damn, I gotta go.
jesse_pinkman What? No, come back here!
walter_white Sorry, I'll do it tomorrow, I promise.
jesse_pinkman Tomorrow?
walter_white I've got a doctor's appointment, I gotta go.
walter_white Look, stay away from him. He's awake.
jesse_pinkman Hey, man, we flipped a coin. We flipped a coin!
doctor#unknown#BreakingBad.Season02.Episode02 We're good? We're very good. We're excellent, I'd say.
skyler_white Girl? You sure? Pretty sure.
walter_white Can I tell you this is exactly what I was hoping?
skyler_white You remember you said that when she's 16 and starts dating.
doctor#unknown#BreakingBad.Season02.Episode02 Looking fabulous.
skyler_white Who is Jesse Pinkman? Jesse Jesse Pinkman.
walter_white Yeah. He was nobody.
skyler_white Who is he to you? Why is he calling? What is this big secret you seem to be discussing with some druggie burnout? You don't come home last night until 2 in the morning, you don't tell me where you've been.
walter_white He sells me pot.
skyler_white He sells you pot? Marijuana, yeah.
walter_white Not a lot. I mean, I don't know. I kinda like it.
skyler_white Are you out of your mind? What are you, like 16 years old? Your brotherinlaw is a DEA agent. What is wrong with you?
walter_white Skyler I just haven't quite been myself lately.
skyler_white Yeah, no shit.
walter_white I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.
walter_white Stop! Stop in 15 minutes.
jesse_pinkman Just meat, is all.
jesse_pinkman Oh, Jesus. It's cool, you're cool.
jesse_pinkman This is private property! Just a minute.
skyler_white Hey, don't touch me! Do not touch me.
jesse_pinkman All right, look, not touching, okay? Not touching here.
skyler_white Well, my name is Skyler White, yo.
jesse_pinkman Seriously?
skyler_white That's right.
jesse_pinkman Okay?
skyler_white I mean it.
jesse_pinkman I think so, yeah.
skyler_white No more marijuana.
jesse_pinkman I can dig it.
skyler_white You can dig it. Wonderful.
jesse_pinkman Okay.
jesse_pinkman "Let's go to your house, yo! "Makes perfect sense.
jesse_pinkman I always dreamt about, I don't know, melting bodies.
walter_white Where did you hear that?
jesse_pinkman Your freaking wife told me when she was here all up on my shit.Yeah, that's right. She almost caught me moving Emilio! Good job in wearing the pants in the family.
walter_white Because somehow, it seemed preferable to admitting that I cook crystal meth and killed a man.
walter_white Is that what I think it is?
jesse_pinkman Yeah, it is.
jesse_pinkman I smoked a bowl, so what? My house, my rules.
jesse_pinkman Hey, no, no! Don't give me that, okay?
walter_white Well, boohoo. I have the truly awful job here.
jesse_pinkman You wanna talk awful? You wanna go there?
walter_white Bathtub? What What do you mean, "bathtub"?
jesse_pinkman That's another thing, Why you got me running around town, trying to find some stupid piece of plastic, when I have a perfectly good tub I can use?
walter_white Oh, God.
walter_white I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes.

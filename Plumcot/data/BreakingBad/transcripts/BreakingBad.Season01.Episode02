driver#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Shit!
driver#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 To the camera My name is Walter Hartwell White. I live at 308 Negra Arroya Lane, Albuquerque, New Mexico 87104. To all law enforcement entities, this is not an admission of guilt. I am speaking to my family now.
walter_white Skyler, you are the love of my life. I hope you know that. Walter Jr., you're my big man. There are going to be some things that you're going to come to learn about me in the next few days. I just want you to know that no matter how it may look, I only had you in my heart.
walter_white Goodbye
skyler_white Happy birthday. Kisses Walt on the cheek
walter_white Look at that
skyler_white That is veggie bacon, believe it or not. Zero cholesterol and you won't even taste the difference.
walter_white Hmm. sniffs veggie bacon
skyler_white What time do you think you'll be home?
walter_white Same time.
skyler_white I don't want him dicking you around tonight. You get paid til 5, you work til 5, no later.
walter_white_jr Hey.
walter_white_jr Happy birthday!
walter_white Why thank you!
skyler_white You're late...again.
walter_white_jr There was no hot water...again.
skyler_white I have an easy fix for that. You wake up early, and then you get to be the first person in the shower.
walter_white_jr I have an idea. How about buy a new hot water heater? How's that idea? For the millionth, billionth time.
skyler_white Did you take your echinacea?
walter_white Yup. I think it's getting better.
walter_white_jr What the hell is this?
skyler_white Hey--
walter_white --it's veggie bacon. Watching our cholesterol... I guess.
walter_white_jr Not me, I want real bacon. None of this fake crap.
skyler_white Too bad, eat it.
walter_white_jr Phew. This smells like Band-Aids.
skyler_white Eat. it.
walter_white_jr So, how's it feel to be old?
walter_white How does it feel to be a smartass?
walter_white_jr Good.
walter_white Eat your veggie bacon.
walter_white You all set?
walter_white_jr Yeah, I'm fine.
walter_white Alright, see you in a little.
walter_white_jr OK, seeya.
walter_white Chemistry. It is the study of what?
walter_white Anyone?
walter_white Ben?
ben Chemicals.
walter_white Chemicals! No. Chemistry is... Well technically, chemistry is the study of matter. But I prefer to see it as the study of change. Now just... Just think about this.
walter_white Electrons change their energy levels. Molecules change their bonds.
walter_white Elements, they combine and change into compounds. Well that's, that's all of life, right? I mean it's just the constant, it's the cycle, it's solution...dissolution. Just over and over and over.
walter_white It is growth, then decay, then transformation. It is fascinating, really.
walter_white Chad. Is there something wrong with your table?
walter_white OK. Ionic bonds...
walter_white Are you done? Ionic bonds, chapter 6.
walter_white 1, 2, 3 makes 10, and 10 makes 20. Here's your receipt. Just give this to your carwash professional. Thank you, come again.
bogdan_wolynetz He's not coming. He says he quits. I'm gonna run the register.
walter_white Bogdan, no. We talked about this.
bogdan_wolynetz I'm shorthanded, Walter. What am I to do?
bogdan_wolynetz Walter?
bogdan_wolynetz What am I to do?
chad Hey, Mr. White!
chad Makes those tires shine, huh?
chads_girlfriend#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Oh my god! You will not believe who's cleaning Chad's car

carmen_molina Nice to meet you.
marie_schrader Hi.
hank_schrader Glock 22. That's my daily carry, OK. I mean unless you're talking, what, Plus V Plus slugs, you forget the 9 mill, alright. Shit, I've seen one of those bounce of a windshield one time.

hank_schrader Hey, it's not gonna bite ya, alright? He looks like Keith Richards with a glass of warm milk.
hank_schrader Hey everybody, listen up, listen up. I'm gonna give a little toast, a little toast to my brother-in-law, c'mere! Walt, you got a brain the size of Wisconsin. But we're not gonna hold that against ya.
hank_schrader But your heart's in the right place, man. You're heart's in the right place. We love you man, we love you. Everybody -- to Walt! Nostrovia!
everyone#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Nostrovia!
hank_schrader Oh shit, turn on channel 3!
hank_schrader ...at which point we apprehended three individuals and placed them into custody. I'm proud to say the outstanding professionalism of my fellow agents at the Albuquerque district office resulted in a substantial amount of methamphetamine being taken off the streets
interviewer#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Were any shots fired?
hank_schrader No ma'am. Our agents took the suspects by surprise.
steven_gomez Damn, the camera does add 10 pounds.
marie_schrader 10 pounds?
hank_schrader Hey, sit and spin, both of ya.
skyler_white Hank...
hank_schrader What...?
hank_schrader Sorry, you didn't see that
hank_schrader ...it's clearly an ongoing operation. Which was well-organized...
walter_white Hank, how much money is that?
hank_schrader That's about $700 grand, pretty good haul.
walter_white Wow...
hank_schrader As I say, it's a good day for the citizens of Albuquerque when we can put this big of a dent into the local drug trade.
walter_white That's unusual isn't it, that kind of cash?
hank_schrader It's not the most we ever took. It's easy money -- til we catch ya. Walt just say the word and I'll take you on a ride along. Y'know, you can watch us knock down a meth lab. Get a little excitement in your life.
walter_white Some day.
walter_white Which one's this?
skyler_white The faux-Lalique vase I picked up at the super-swap.
walter_white How's it doing?
skyler_white Well, I met my reserve, and there's still 2 minutes.
walter_white Wow.
walter_white What's up?
skyler_white You tell me, birthday boy.
skyler_white Oh hey, so what's up for Saturday?
walter_white Carwash. Bogdan said he needed me.
skyler_white Til what time? Noon, 1ish?
walter_white Probably 2, more like.
skyler_white And then what after that?
walter_white Actually, I was thinking of driving up to Los Alamos. The visitor center has an exhibit that's really supposed to be...
skyler_white You're not gonna paint?
walter_white No, I'll paint. It's just that, you know this exhibition on Mars rover photographs... I mean the detail really is supposed to be amazing.
skyler_white It's just that I really need you to paint at some point, the sooner the back bedroom gets finished...
walter_white I know, I know.
skyler_white And I'd do it myself except that you said you don't want me standing on the step ladder...
walter_white I'll paint.
skyler_white OK.
skyler_white What is going on down there? Is he asleep?
walter_white It's nothing, it's just... I dunno. You gotta be careful about the baby.
skyler_white Don't worry about the baby, this is just for you. We are just doing you tonight. Just close your eyes, and relax, and let...
skyler_white Close your eyes.
walter_white Mm, OK.
skyler_white There ya go. That's it, that's it. There you go. Keep it going, keep it going. Keep it going, keep...
skyler_white YES!!
skyler_white 56! Woo!
walter_white This is so embarrassing. I’m fine, honestly. It’s just some bug going around. First my wife had it, then my son, now me. It’s just like a chest cold. It could be low blood sugar as well, I didn’t have the greatest breakfast this morning.
walter_white Hey, can you do me a favor? Can you just drop me off at a corner or something?
paramedic#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Uh, no. Sorry.
walter_white It’s just that I don’t have the greatest insurance
paramedic#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Take a couple of deep breaths for me
paramedic#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Is there anybody you want us to contact for you?
walter_white Ha. God no.
paramedic#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Lean forward for me, would ya?
paramedic#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Mr. White are you a smoker?
walter_white No. Never. Why do you ask?
doctor#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Mr. White? Mr. White?
walter_white Yes?
doctor#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 You understood what I’ve just said to you.
walter_white Yes. Lung cancer. Inoperable.
doctor#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 I’m sorry. I just need to make sure you fully understand.
walter_white Best case scenario, with chemo, I’ll live maybe another couple years. It’s just… You’ve got mustard on your… Mustard there… Right there….
skyler_white So my records show that I paid it and I certainly don’t feel that we owe any late…
skyler_white Alright.
skyler_white Well, um, I’ll check with the bank, and maybe the post office lost it or something? Yeah. Let me look into that. OK. Thank you.
skyler_white Hey.
walter_white Hey.
skyler_white Did you use the Mastercard last month, $15.88 at Staples?
walter_white We needed printer paper.
skyler_white Walt, the Mastercard’s the one we don’t use.
walter_white OK.
skyler_white So, how was your day?
walter_white I don’t know it was… fine.
bogdan_wolynetz Walter. Come on, man, I am shorthanded, I need you outside to do some wipedowns. Come on.

hank_schrader Nah.
walter_white Oh good, good… Oh no no, nothing’s wrong I just, uh, I’ve been thinking about that offer. That ride along.
hank_schrader It’s the last house on the right. See it? Not the two story one, the one next to it. Uh, kind of, um, I dunno what do you call that, um, green?
steven_gomez Sage.
hank_schrader Sage? Do you work at the fucking pottery barn? Jesus
steven_gomez Sage. That’s the word for it. My fault the only word your dumb ass knows is green?
hank_schrader Cheese dick. I know that one, how bout that?
hank_schrader Anyway, it’s the “sage” one, see it?
walter_white So, what tells you it’s a meth lab?
hank_schrader Just our snitch. Says, uh, some dude goes by “Cap’n Cook”. Lives up to his name in there. He always adds a dash of chili powder.
hank_schrader You exuberant Mexicans.
steven_gomez Uh uh. Cap’n Cook? That’s a white boy’s name. Dopey as hell, too.
hank_schrader Yeah? Tell you what. I bet you 20 bucks that says he’s a beaner.
steven_gomez Alright, you’re one.
hank_schrader Come on, come on, come on, come on…
hank_schrader Alright, school bus is clear, you got the green light.
hank_schrader Watch this, it makes em shit.
dea_agents#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Go, go, go.
hank_schrader Meth labs are nasty on a good day, you mix that shit wrong and you got mustard gas.
walter_white Phosphine gas.
walter_white I think…
hank_schrader Yeah, exactly. One whiff will kill ya, that’s why the respirators
agent#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 House is clear, one suspect in custody.
hank_schrader Copy that. The suspect, might he be of the Latino persuasion?
agent#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Driver’s license says Emilio Koyama.
steven_gomez Asian! Pay up sucker.
hank_schrader Hey, hey! First name Emilio, that’s at least half a beaner. I tell you what, I’ll let you off for a 10. Cheer up Gomie, you people still got JLo.
walter_white Hank, you think I might get to go inside? See the actual lab?
hank_schrader Uhhhh, yeah. Yeah. I tell you what, we’re gonna go peek our heads in, check it out first, you stay here a minute.
walter_white Oh my god.
jesse_pinkman Fuck.
walter_white Oh my god. Pinkman?
walter_white Hey, uh, it’s me. I’m alone.
jesse_pinkman How’d you find me?
walter_white You’re still in our filing system. So your aunt owns this place, right?
jesse_pinkman I own it.
walter_white Look, no one’s looking for you.
jesse_pinkman Why are you here?
walter_white I was curious. Honestly I never expected you to amount to much, but methamphetamine? I didn’t picture that. There’s a lot of money in it, huh?
jesse_pinkman I don’t know what you’re talking about.
walter_white No?
jesse_pinkman Not a clue.
walter_white Cap’n Cook? That’s not you?
walter_white Like I said, no one is looking for you.
jesse_pinkman Look, I don’t know what you think you’re doing here, Mr. White. I mean if you’re planning on giving me some bullwinder about getting right with Jesus, or turn myself in…
walter_white Not really.
jesse_pinkman ...high school was a long time ago, OK? You ain’t “Welcome Back Kotter”, so step off. No speeches.
walter_white Short speech. You lost your partner today. What’s his name, Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. DEA took all your money, your lab, you got nothing. Square one. But you know the business, and I know the chemistry.
walter_white I’m thinking maybe you and I could partner up.
jesse_pinkman You, uh, you wanna cook crystal meth?
jesse_pinkman You? You and uh.. and me?
walter_white That’s right.
jesse_pinkman Wow.
walter_white Either that or I turn you in.
marie_schrader What the hell is this?
skyler_white Hell if I know, I described it as mosaic folk art.
marie_schrader Somebody bought it?
skyler_white Yeah, some guy in Minneapolis. $14 plus shipping.
marie_schrader At this rate, in 50 or 60 years you’ll be rich.
marie_schrader So how goes the novel?
skyler_white It’s not a novel, actually, which I have...
marie_schrader You’re not writing a novel? You told me you were.
skyler_white No. Short stories. I said that maybe if eventually I have enough good ones that maybe I’ll try and publish another collection
marie_schrader Well those really didn’t sell. I just thought a novel would be easier to sell.
skyler_white Yeah, well, maybe so.
marie_schrader Ever want me to read anything I could critique it for you.
skyler_white Oh? No.
skyler_white I mean I’m just not at that stage where I… no.
marie_schrader Open offer. So what’s up with Walt lately?
skyler_white What do you mean? He’s fine.
marie_schrader He just seems, I don’t know, quieter than usual.
skyler_white Turning fifty’s a big deal. I mean I’m sure as hell not looking forward to forty. You’re gonna be a complete basket case.
marie_schrader So it’s a mid-life crisis?
skyler_white No, he’s just quiet.
marie_schrader How’s the sex?
skyler_white Marie! Jesus
marie_schrader Guess that answers that.
walter_white You just gonna sit there?
walter_white Look at this, look at this. A Kjeldahl-style recovery flask. 800 milliliters. Very rare. You got your usual paraphernelia, Griffin beakers, your Erlenmeyer flask. But -- the piece de resistance. Round bottom boiler flask, 5,000 millileters.
jesse_pinkman Well I cook in one of those. A big one.
walter_white One of these? No, this is a volumetric flask, you wouldn’t cook in one of these.
jesse_pinkman Uh, yeah. I do.
walter_white Uh, no. You don’t. A volumetric flask is for general mixing an titration. You wouldn’t apply heat to a volumetric flask, that’s what a boiling flask is for. Did you learn nothing from my chemistry class?
jesse_pinkman No. You flunked me. Remember?
walter_white No wonder.
jesse_pinkman Prick! And let me tell you something else. This ain’t chemistry. OK, this is art.
walter_white Oh?
jesse_pinkman Cooking is art. And the shit I cook is the bomb, so don’t be telling me.
walter_white The shit you cook is shit. I saw your setup, ridiculous! You and I will not make garbage. We will produce a chemically pure and stable product that performs as advertised. No adulterants, no baby powder, no chili powder.
jesse_pinkman No, no, chili P is my signature.
walter_white Not anymore.
jesse_pinkman Yeah, well we’ll see about that. What the hell is this?
walter_white Lab safety equipment. We’re also gonna gave an emergency eye wash station. These chemicals and their fumes are toxic, in case you didn’t know that.
jesse_pinkman Well you can dress up like a faggot if you want, not me.
jesse_pinkman Listen this doesn’t stay for more than a day.
walter_white What? I thought we were gonna cook here?
jesse_pinkman No, we’re not gonna cook here. This is my house, I don’t shit where I eat.
walter_white Well then where are we gonna work?
jesse_pinkman You tell me. This is your deal man, you wanna smoke it up smoke it up at your house.
jesse_pinkman Nah, I didn’t think so. Oh well.
walter_white Well, what if we rented one of those self storage places, you know one of those little orange garages and worked out of there?
jesse_pinkman No. They’re onto that, they got dogs that sniff around. RV, that’s what you want.
walter_white What, like a Winnebago?
jesse_pinkman Yeah. Now I know a dude who wants to sell his, just goes camping with it. But a mobile meth lab? That’d be the bomb. I mean drive way out in the boonies, be all evasive.
jesse_pinkman Dude this isn’t even 7 grand, alright, my guy wants 85.
walter_white This is all of the money I have in the world. You’re a drug dealer, negotiate.
jesse_pinkman You are not how I remembered you from class, I mean like not at all.
walter_white Well I gotta go.
jesse_pinkman Wait, wait, hold up. Tell me why you’re doing this. Seriously.
walter_white Why do you do it?
jesse_pinkman Money, mainly.
walter_white There you go.
jesse_pinkman Nah, come on! Some straight like you, giant stick up his ass, all of a sudden at age, what, sixty? He’s just gonna break bad?
walter_white I’m 50.
jesse_pinkman It’s weird is all, OK? It doesn’t compute. Listen, if you’ve gone crazy or something, I mean if you’ve gone crazy or depressed I’m just saying that’s something I need to know about, OK? I mean that affects me.
walter_white I am awake.
jesse_pinkman What?!
walter_white Buy the RV.
walter_white We start tomorrow.
skyler_white How’s it coming in there?
walter_white_jr Fine.
skyler_white Do you want me or your dad?
walter_white_jr Dad.
skyler_white So how are those feeling in the waist? Are they too tight? Because you don’t want to get them if they’re too tight.
walter_white_jr They’re…
walter_white_jr They’re pre-shrunk.
skyler_white Are you sure you don’t wanna get like a different kind, like the, you know, the skinny jeans? Because those are really supposed to be in style now. The skaters wear them.
walter_white_jr Do I look like a skater?
skyler_white Alright.
bully#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Hey mom, check out my big boy pants. Momma could you zip up my big boy pants?
walter_white Don’t.
skyler_white Walt?!
walter_white_jr What…
skyler_white I have no idea.
skyler_white You know what, don’t even look at them. They’re obviously very stupid.
skyler_white Yeah. I think that um, I think that those jeans look really good on you. I think you should get them if you like them, OK? You know what, why don’t you just hang out here for a second, I’ll be right back.
bully#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Oh no! Mommy I think that I pinched a loaf in my brand new big boy pants!
bully#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Ow! What are you doing?

walter_white TAKE IT!
walter_white Come on, come on.
bullys_friends#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Come on lets’ get out of here, let’s go.
bully#unknown#Breakingbad.Season01.Episode02 Psycho.
jesse_pinkman Yeah, nothing but cows. Got some big cow-house way out that way, like 2 miles. But I don’t see nobody.
walter_white “Cow house”?
jesse_pinkman Yeah. Where they live. The cows. Whatever man. Shit, yeah let’s cook here.
walter_white Cow house… God help me.
jesse_pinkman Uh, what are you doing?
walter_white These are my good clothes. Can’t go home smelling like a meth lab.
jesse_pinkman Uh, yeah you can, I do.
jesse_pinkman Those? Those, uh, wow. You’re keeping those on right?
walter_white Come on. Daylight’s burning.
jesse_pinkman Oh my god.
jesse_pinkman Wow, that’s a good look for you. I mean you’re maybe only the world’s second biggest homo.
walter_white Shut up and help me.
jesse_pinkman Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Work it baby. Work it.
walter_white Turn that off!
jesse_pinkman This is glass grade. I mean you got… Jesus, you got crystals in here two inches, three inches long! This is pure glass!
walter_white Yeah.
jesse_pinkman You’re a goddamn artist! This is art Mr. White!
walter_white Actually it’s just basic chemistry, but thank you Jesse, I’m glad it’s acceptable.
jesse_pinkman Acceptable? You’re the goddamn Iron Chef! Every jibbhead from here to Timbuktu’s gonna want a taste. Man I gotta try this.
walter_white No. No. No, we only sell it, we don’t use it.
jesse_pinkman OK, since when? Listen, you’ve been watching way too much Miami Vice. That ain’t happening.
walter_white So, what now? How do we proceed?
jesse_pinkman We cook more tomorrow. Meantime, I know just the guy to talk to.
jesse_pinkman Hey, yo. Kraze, how you doing my man? You got a new dog, right on man. What’s his name?
jesse_pinkman Yeah I had a dog like that once. Maybe like twice as big. Super purebred. Now me personally, I would train him to go straight for the, uh, nutsac.
krazy8 Shut your mouth and show me your money.
jesse_pinkman I ain’t buying, ese. I’m selling.

jesse_pinkman Whoa whoa whoa, hey that is bullshit. That is bullshit, Krazy 8! You know I should kick his punk ass for even thinking that. You know what, next time you talk to Emilio you tell him for me, alright?

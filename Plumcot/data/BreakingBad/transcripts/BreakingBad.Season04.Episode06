walter_white *on answering machine* Uh, it's me. I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids and uh, I love you.
walter_white *on answering machine* Uh, it's me. I just wanted to say that I was thinking about you and the kids and uh...
walter_white Morning.
skyler_white Afternoon.
walter_white Oh, really? Jesus. You shouldn't have let me sleep.
skyler_white You needed it.
walter_white *sighs* *laughs* Skyler, I don't entirely remember what happened last night. I may have said some things that...
skyler_white Did you know this Gale Boetticher person?
walter_white Skyler, I can't even focus.
skyler_white Gale Boetticher. Did you know him?
walter_white Oh my God, what...what exactly did I say last night?
skyler_white Just enough. Did you work together?
skyler_white Who killed him? Was it the people you work for?
walter_white Definitely not.
skyler_white Was it somebody who at some point might want to do the same to you?
walter_white I seriously doubt it. No.
walter_white Oh God.
skyler_white I think I know what happened last night, Walt.
walter_white I know exactly what happened last night I drank too much wine.
skyler_white You told Hank that the man he was looking for might still be out there. That it might not be this Boetticher after all. And I was up all night wondering why you would say that to him.
walter_white Cause I was drunk, Skyler.
skyler_white No, but then. But then I was remembering your black eye. Your, uh, business disagreement that you don't want to talk about?
walter_white Look, I don't want to talk about any of this, ever. The firewall, alright? Church and State, that's how we need to approach this thing.
skyler_white And then I remembered the message you left me the other day. When you said you loved me. When I heard that I thought that maybe, you, I don't know, that you were regretting what's happened between us and I get that. After last night...Walt I think you're scared. I think that message was some kind of goodbye.
walter_white No, Skyler.
skyler_white I think last night was a cry for help.
walter_white Oh, Jesus, a cry for help.
skyler_white I think some part of you wants Hank to catch you.
walter_white Wow! That is just. That is...that is it! Exactly, yes! You're like Dr. Joyce Brothers here, God.
skyler_white If he caught you at least this would all be over.
walter_white Oh yeah, this is a tremendous weight just lifted off me. Now I understand myself, thank you. Thank you.
skyler_white Walt, I've said it before. If you are in danger we go to the police.
walter_white Oh, no, I don't wanna hear about the police.
skyler_white I do not say that lightly. I know what it could do to this family, but if it's the only real choice we have. If it's either that or you getting shot when you open your front door
walter_white I don't want to hear about the police
skyler_white You're not some hardened criminal, Walt. You are in over your head. That's what we tell them and that's the truth.
walter_white No, it's not the truth.
skyler_white Of course it is. A school teacher, cancer, desperate for money?
walter_white Okay, we're done here.
skyler_white Roped into working for unable to even quit! You told me that yourself Walt. Jesus, what was I thinking? Walt, please, let's both of us stop trying to justify this whole thing and admit that you're in danger.
walter_white Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn't believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going into work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!
walter_white Look, I was...
walter_white Skyler?
bogdan_wolynetz Here we are. Just like you left it. And where is your pretty wife?
walter_white She has other business to attend to.
bogdan_wolynetz Well, like I say to her, place sells as is, understand?
walter_white Yes, I understand.
bogdan_wolynetz Good, good. I don't want her coming back with more demands. She gave me hard time when we settled on price.
walter_white We're all on the same page, Bogdan.
bogdan_wolynetz So, here's everything you need. I keep very good files.
walter_white Thank you.
bogdan_wolynetz So you are the boss now, huh? You think you're ready?
walter_white Yes, I...I think so.
bogdan_wolynetz Being boss is tough. I know you think I was hard on you, but you'll learn, being in charge is not easy. It takes hard work.
walter_white You've seen me work hard, Bogdan.
bogdan_wolynetz Yeah? I don't know. Not so much, maybe. Maybe when you are the boss you will just keep your feet up and relax. The real important thing, and not everyone knows this, is to be tough. Boss has to be tough. Has to say no to people. Has to make cashiers wipe down cars, even if they don't want to. Can you be tough, Walter? *laughs* I'm sure you can handle. And if not, you can always call your wife, huh?
bogdan_wolynetz Always sticky, no problem. As is.
bogdan_wolynetz Who'd have thought that some day I would be handing these keys to you?
bogdan_wolynetz Many years. Almost forgot.
walter_white Bogdan. As is.
mike_ehrmantraut Thank you.
waitress#unknown#BreakingBad.Season04.Episode06 Mmhmm.
mike_ehrmantraut You okay there?
jesse_pinkman I'm fine. Just not, not using is...
mike_ehrmantraut Eat something.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah? That's right, both of 'em. I'm on my way.
jesse_pinkman You need any help?
mike_ehrmantraut No.
walter_white_jr You want me to call her back?
walter_white Eh, no. What exactly did she say? Exactly.
walter_white_jr Just, you know, she asked if I was okay and not to worry. Like that.
walter_white Hmm. Any, uh, rough time table on this thing, as to when she's coming home?
walter_white_jr It's about the gambling, right?
walter_white Well, it'sit's kind of hard to.
walter_white_jr She can't understand. It's not like you're doing this on purpose, you can't help it.
walter_white It's not that simple.
walter_white_jr Look, you have a disease. It's like you're an alcoholic, right?
walter_white No, it's not like that at all.
walter_white_jr Yes it is, I read online. She's not even allowed to be mad at you. And she can't be mad at you about the cancer, can she?
walter_white Son, son. These are two very different things.
walter_white_jr Not really. Gambling addiction is a sickness, you can't
walter_white Listen. What is going on with me is not about some disease, it's about choices. Choices that I have made. Choices I stand by.
walter_white_jr You're not moving back in, are you?
walter_white No. Hey, you know what? School can wait. Why don't we take a little detour?
walter_white_jr What kind of detour?
walter_white You'll see.
walter_white I think it's time you got you your own car, what do you think?
walter_white What?
walter_white_jr I think if you're gonna buy me off...buy me off.
walter_white Wow.
walter_white_jr Amazing. It's amazing.
walter_white Yeah, it's good lookin'. Good, I'm glad you like it.
walter_white_jr I do, thank you dad.
walter_white Alright, you're welcome.
walter_white So you're here?
jesse_pinkman Yeah.
walter_white You're actually here to work?
jesse_pinkman Yeah, man. Jesus.
walter_white Jesse. Come here.
walter_white Alright, I need an update.
jesse_pinkman An update on what?
walter_white An update on these little field trips you've been taking with Mike.
jesse_pinkman I told you already, we pick up money, check on things. Stuff like that.
walter_white And you're his bodyguard right? Well what? That's what you said.
jesse_pinkman I said I guarded him. Like backup. Like a second set of eyes. Everybody needs backup, right?
walter_white And this has to be you? It can't be, I don't know, Tyrus or any of the couple thousand muscleheads that Gus has working for him? It has to be Jesse Pinkman. Why? What is there something about you that I don't know? Are you a former Navy Seal? Do you have to have your registered as lethal weapons?
jesse_pinkman Register this.
walter_white All I'm saying is that, do you not even question this? Do you really believe you mean anything to these people? And I'm not trying to be insulting I'm just trying to make you see things clearly.
jesse_pinkman I see they can't outright kill me, but they don't want me getting high. I see this thing probably started as Gus getting Mike to babysit me. But you know what? I saved Mike from getting robbed. Even killed, maybe. So maybe I'm not such a loser after all!
walter_white I mean what if it...oh God. I mean what if it, what if it's all just a setup?
jesse_pinkman What?
walter_white What if this robbery that you stopped wasn't even real? I mean, think about it. Your first day out guarding Mike. He steps out for one second and what happens? You immediately get robbed.
jesse_pinkman You're such an asshole.
walter_white Keep your friends close, keep your enemies closer. Like you said, Gus can't kill you because of me. He knows I won't stand for it. He needs me and he hates the fact that he needs me so what does he do? He goes to work driving a wedge between you and me.
jesse_pinkman You're an asshole. If you'd been there, you'd know it wasn't a setup.
walter_white Wait a minute. How long did those guys chase you? Huh? Because the way you describe it they gave up pretty damn easy. No, no, this...this whole thing. All of this! It's all about me.
walter_white Hello. Uh, look just, hang on.
jesse_pinkman Yeah.I'll be right up.
walter_white What?
jesse_pinkman I gotta go.
walter_white Whaam I supposed to clean all this on my own?

jesse_pinkman What's the deal?
mike_ehrmantraut Well, the deal is we're watching that house. Couple down on the left with the tree in the front?
jesse_pinkman Yeah? What for?
mike_ehrmantraut Well a little birdy told me there's some guys in there that have 3 pounds of our product, which they're selling. And which they sure as hell didn't get from us.
jesse_pinkman So, what's the plan?
mike_ehrmantraut I just told you. We sit here and watch that house. Until one of our entrepreneurs pops his head out, then we ask a few questions and get our property back.
jesse_pinkman Why don't you just go break the door down, pistol whip those bitches and show 'em who's boss?
mike_ehrmantraut Because a little birdy also told me these guys are heavily into the product and most likely armed. And what you may not know about meth heads, or maybe you do, they're kind of unpredictable. I don't care for unpredictable, so we wait. Sorry to burst your bubble kid, but that's 90% of the job. Don't worry, I brought sandwiches. Yes sir. Uhh, pimeno cheese? How's that sound?
mike_ehrmantraut Woah woah woah, where do you think you're going?
jesse_pinkman You said they're sellin', right? Maybe I'm lookin' to buy.
tucker Who the hell are you?
scary_skell Tucker!
jesse_pinkman I'm here to buy.
tucker Not my question.
scary_skell Tucker why'd you answer the door? Tucker! Tucker!
jesse_pinkman My name's Diesel. Heard you maybe had some of the blue?
scary_skell Tucker! Shut the door Tucker!
jesse_pinkman I'm just lookin' for a teenth, yo, come on. Help a brother out.
scary_skell Tucker! Tucker will you shut the damn door?!
tucker We don't sell to strangers. Get off the porch asshole.
scary_skell Tucker! Tucker will you shut the door?
tucker Alright already, Jesus!
mike_ehrmantraut Guess we'll go with plan A then.
jesse_pinkman Pop the trunk, would ya?
mike_ehrmantraut Why?
jesse_pinkman There's something in there I need.
mike_ehrmantraut And what would that be?
jesse_pinkman I'm getting those pricks out of that house.
mike_ehrmantraut Oh with your first attempt being such a wild success.
jesse_pinkman You may know this whole P.I. sit in the car business, but I know meth heads.
tucker What are you doing?
jesse_pinkman Digging.
tucker Why?
jesse_pinkman Oh, you know why.
tucker How deep are you going?
jesse_pinkman I don't know, how deep do you think it is?
tucker Pretty deep.
jesse_pinkman Hey uh, you mind taking over for a minute?
tucker Yeah, sure.
jesse_pinkman Hey, uh, mind if I use your John?
tucker Yeah.
scary_skell Tucker! Tucker! Tucker! Who the hell are you?
jesse_pinkman Alright, hey, it's cool. I'm a, I'm a friend of Tucker's.
scary_skell What do you want?
jesse_pinkman I just, uh, I just wanna buy some of the blue.
scary_skell It's not for sale.
jesse_pinkman Well I know that you were selling it earlier, so
scary_skell Oh yeah, how do you know that?
jesse_pinkman Uh, Tucker told me.
scary_skell Yeah well, Tucker needs to learn to keep his damn mouth shut. Tucker! Tucker!
jesse_pinkman So uh, you gonna hook me up?
scary_skell Don't have enough for all of Tucker's asshole friends. Tucker!
jesse_pinkman You know I think he's outside. You wanna just go outside?
scary_skell Tucker! Tucker!
jesse_pinkman Hey, hey. Let's go find Tucker. Okay? Let's go outside and
scary_skell I don't have enough for you. Alright?
jesse_pinkman Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, okay. I don't wanna start any trouble
scary_skell Trouble? Trouble, what does that mean, trouble?
jesse_pinkman No no no, I'm just sayin', we're cool. Okay, we're good.
scary_skell What? You can't know that. What does that mean? What? You don't put thoughts in my head. You don't put thoughts in my head!
jesse_pinkman Absolutely, you're right. You're right.
scary_skell Tucker?
walter_white Muchos gracias amigas. Muchos gracias.
walter_white There you go, Maria.
marie_schrader Oh, gracias.

worker_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season04.Episode06 Muchos gracias.
walter_white Si, there you go. So uh, usted residar circa? Si?
walter_white I missed that one, I'm sure it was good. Now mas
tyrus_kitt *to workers* Vengan conmigo.
walter_white Wait a minute, where are you taking them? Come on Tyrus, what are you doing?
tyrus_kitt I'm putting them on a bus.
walter_white Why? What bus?
tyrus_kitt One that takes them back to Honduras.
walter_white Hey, wait a second. Wait a minute. This was my idea, don't punish them. You tell Gus to blame me, not them.
tyrus_kitt He does.
mike_ehrmantraut *to Jesse* Give us a minute, will ya?
gustavo_fring *to Jesse* We won't be too long.
mike_ehrmantraut The crew that hit our truck gave away the cargo to a couple local nobodies. And very disciplined of not keeping any for themselves. It was all about sending a message. Which they did, literally. It was written on the bucket lid. "Ready to talk?" That I believe was the English translation. I know you're not really asking for advice, but let me hire 10, 15 more good operators and we hit 'em back, hit 'em hard, hit 'em where they live.
gustavo_fring No. This war stays cold for now.
mike_ehrmantraut What about their message? What's the answer?
gustavo_fring *sighs* Set up a meeting, let's see what they have to say. How did he do today?
gustavo_fring I hear you can handle yourself.
jesse_pinkman I guess.
gustavo_fring Goodnight.
jesse_pinkman Hey, excuse me. Why me?
gustavo_fring I like to think I see things in people.
walter_white *to Junior* Slow down. The car's not going anywhere.
walter_white_jr Mom!
skyler_white Hey, sweetheart. Hi.
walter_white_jr Hey.
walter_white_jr So, did you see what's in the driveway?
skyler_white Uhh, yeah I saw. Hey. *kisses Junior on the cheek* So that's yours, huh?
walter_white_jr Yeah, dad got it for me.
skyler_white Well that was very nice of him.
walter_white_jr Yeah. I know it looks like...well...awesome, but it's super safe. Dad made sure. And I promise to always go the speed limit, or below. Way below. And it gets great gas mileage. So, dad said I could take it around the block a few times, is that okay? Just around the block.
skyler_white Yeah, just around the block. And be careful, okay?
walter_white_jr I will.
walter_white_jr It's really great to have you home, mom.
walter_white *to Junior* Hey, seriously be careful. Okay?
walter_white_jr I know.
walter_white I guess we should talk.
skyler_white Well, I think you said plenty the other day.
walter_white Look, about that...it just...
skyler_white Did you get the carwash keys?
walter_white Um, yes. Yes.
walter_white Skyler. I may have overstated things earlier. And I'm sorry to be so, forward, but I just want you to know something. I want you to I need you to understand that you are safe. You, Junior, Holly. You are completely safe. Everything that I do, everything. I do it to protect this family.
skyler_white So buying that car, that was protecting your family?
walter_white Okay. Alright maybe it's a little flashy, but he needed a car. And I'm his father I should be able to get what he wants.
skyler_white It goes back. Tomorrow.
walter_white Skyler, it will crush him.
skyler_white That car directly contradicts our story and if you're so invested in protecting this family, it means protecting this story. What do you think the neighbors will say Walt? What about Hank and Marie? How about the IRS? What were you thinking, Walt?
walter_white I was thinking that I wanted to do something nice for my son. Look, I just worry that he'll blame you for this.
skyler_white Oh he will. Once again, he'll blame his bitch mother for taking away what his loving father has given him, so...thanks for that. But you know what, Walt? Someone has to protect this family from the man who protects this family.

skyler_white You're not thinking about going back into work today, are you?
walter_white Thought I would. This inhaler really seems to be doing the trick.
skyler_white Just take the rest of the week, please. You've earned it. Don't push it. Besides, I want you well for the weekend.
walter_white_jr Mom wants to partay.
skyler_white It's just a little gettogether, that's all. Sunday afternoon, maybe? Nothing big just family and a few friends. We've got a lot to celebrate, don't you think?
walter_white Sounds good.
walter_white Thank you.
skyler_white Now. What are you supposed to do today?
walter_white Nothing.
skyler_white Excellent. Brownie points for taking a nap.
walter_white Can you meet?
jesse_pinkman I thought maybe you might've, you know, kicked. Signed off. I was even checking the obits.
walter_white No such luck.
jesse_pinkman So, umm, where's it stand? Coughing up blood, giving speeches you know like, I deserve this, I'm an asshole, what's the upshot?
walter_white The upshot? The upshot is that I have radiation pneumonitis.
jesse_pinkman Damn.
walter_white Actually it's not as bad as it sounds. It's a fairly common occurrence, easily treated. In fact, the news is all good.
jesse_pinkman You mean good? You mean like good good? You mean like remission good?
walter_white Remission. Not to imply I'm cured, I still have cancer, there's been a significant reduction in the tumors.
jesse_pinkman How significant?
walter_white 80%.
jesse_pinkman Dude. No way!
walter_white I'm not out of the woods yet by any stretch, but…"options" is the word they keep batting about.
jesse_pinkman That's awesome! Serious? That's great man. My aunt, she never...I mean you know at your stage, I didn't think that could happen.
walter_white Yeah.
jesse_pinkman Mr. White, you kicked its ass, yo! No. You must be so psyched.
walter_white Of course, I am.
jesse_pinkman Okay, no we...I mean...what do we? Oh hey, almost forgot.
jesse_pinkman So, how do you want to, you know, proceed? In light of this kickass news.
walter_white We'll take our time and stay cautious, sell off what we have, and then uh…well, then I guess I'm done.
hank_schrader Batter up!
skyler_white Umm, everyone. Hey you guys, I would like to make a toast with my nonalcoholic beverage. Umm, I know one party can't begin to repay all your support and your many, many kindnesses. But, then again, Hank does make one mean margarita. Umm, we really do wanna thank you. These last few months have been, wow, a challenging time to put it mildly, but I have to say that Walt has come through it like a champ. *to Walt* Honey, I'm so proud of you.
marie_schrader Aww.
skyler_white Okay, I'm gonna stop with the sappy stuff, but it's true, it really is. And for the first time in a long time we are so excited about the future...okay, anyway, I want to ooh, I want to also express my gratitude to two very special people who couldn't be here today but they send their regrets and their warm wishes. Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz, for those of you who don't know them, are, well, they're heroes. They're incredibly generous friends who made the amazing offer to pay for Walt's treatment and they did. So. To Gretchen and Elliott.
hank_schrader Hey, how about the man of the hour? Come on.
carmen_molina Speech, speech.
walter_white_jr Yeah, Dad.
walter_white Umm, well it's kind of funny. When I got my diagnosis, cancer. I said to myself, you know, why me? And then the other day when I got the good news, I said the same thing. Anyway. Thank you for coming and enjoy.
hank_schrader Alright, cheers...wow, inspirational.
hank_schrader I'll tell you what, I've gotta give those guys points for originality. A little mercury switch, ninevolt battery, five to six ounces of C4. That's how those Cartel boys party.
walter_white_jr Yeah, but why a turtle?
hank_schrader Oh, that's the best part, it was a umm, it was a...what the hell's the word I'm looking for. Not a metaphor, not an analogy, Walt. What's the word I'm looking for? Anyway, Tortuga, that was the name of our snitch. Beanspeak for tortoise, okay? Tortoise, turtle, whatev, I never knew the difference myself. *to Walt* Hey, will you top me off there, buddy? *to Junior* Anyway, poetic I guess, yeah, it was poetic. That's the word. I guess that's the word.
walter_white *looks at Junior* Go ahead.
hank_schrader Better not let your mom see.
hank_schrader Oh, yeah, I think I see a hair, maybe two.
walter_white_jr There's no worm in this, right?
hank_schrader No, that would be mezcal, talk about your hangovers okay. I was back at Glenco Georgia, back east doing some training. Had this firearm instructor, he was a good ol' boy.
hank_schrader This guy could put 'em away like he had two livers, okay. Like a fish, like a drunk fish. We were drinking mezcal stupid, but uh
hank_schrader *to Walt* Hey, hey. Walt. What you doin' there?
walter_white What's it look like I'm doing?
hank_schrader Kid's sixteen. You going for father of the year?
walter_white *to Junior* What are you looking at him for? Hm? We're celebrating.
hank_schrader Hey, no. Jesus. *to Junior* Listen, I'd take a pass on that one if I were you, okay?
hank_schrader Think we've been bogarting this puppy long enough. *laughs*
walter_white *to Hank* Hey! Bring the bottle back.
hank_schrader Sorry buddy, no can do.
walter_white It's my son. My bottle. My house.
hank_schrader *laughs* It's alright.
walter_white What are you waiting for? Bring it back.
hank_schrader Why don't we just call it a day, alright pal? We good?
walter_white The bottle. Now.
skyler_white What's going on?
hank_schrader Jesus.
skyler_white Here sweetie, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay, shh.
jesse_pinkman This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs.
jane_margolis Wow.
jesse_pinkman Uhh, you weren't supposed to wake up.
jane_margolis Ever, or...
jesse_pinkman No, I was just thinking I would bring it in.
jane_margolis You want me to go back to bed?
jesse_pinkman No, I guess that'd be kind of…uh, no.
jane_margolis Need some help?
jesse_pinkman *taking bread out of the toaster* No, ow, ow, I got it, ow, ow…umm, just uh, have a seat.
jane_margolis Is there any coffee?
jesse_pinkman Uh, shit, yeah shit. Give me a second.
jane_margolis Well at least let me do that.
jesse_pinkman No, I don't want you to have to do anything, you know?
jesse_pinkman Alright, here, you take the good one. It's, umm, huevos rancheros.
jane_margolis I can tell.
jesse_pinkman Yeah?
jane_margolis Umm, fork?
jesse_pinkman Oh, yeah.
jesse_pinkman Ah, here you go.
jane_margolis So what are you up to today? Working? Whatever that means.
jesse_pinkman No. I'm all yours.
jane_margolis Really?
skyler_white *on answering machine* Hey, this is Skyler. Please leave me a message, thanks.
walter_white Hi. I just wanted to say that, well, we'll talk tonight, but I wanted to say that I, I'm not exactly sure who that was yesterday, but it wasn't me and I'm sorry. Love you.
walter_white Oh boy.
walter_white *on answering machine* I just wanted to say that, well, we'll talk tonight, but I wanted to say that
ted_beneke Hey there. Wow, who brought the churros?
skyler_white Uh, that would be me. If I leave 'em at home I'd just wind up eating them all myself, so. They're actually, they're leftovers. We had a little gettogether for Walt.
ted_beneke It wasn't his birthday, was it?
skyler_white Actually, Walt's got...he's been battling cancer.
ted_beneke Skyler.
skyler_white And, last week we got good news.
ted_beneke I'm so sorry.
skyler_white We're really optimistic.
ted_beneke Great. Great, good news is great.
skyler_white Yeah. Yeah it is, it really is.
ted_beneke Well, feel free to bring these any time.
skyler_white *laughs* Yeah.
bob Got some real beauts.
walter_white Hmm.
bob You cannot beat thermal efficiency, the C3.
walter_white Yeah. Then again what about tankless?
bob Sure, we got 'em. I mean the good ones will really run up your price though. Set you back about $1200.
walter_white That's not an issue.
bob You want installation, right?
walter_white No. I'll do it myself.
bob That's what I like to hear.
jane_margolis And who's this? This guy can surf without a board?
jesse_pinkman Umm, that's Hoverman, he can surf, skate, glide, whatever cause he's always got a sixinch cushion of air under his feet.
jane_margolis That's cool. Great lines. And this guy? What's his superpower?
jesse_pinkman That's, uh, Kangaman
jane_margolis Kangaman. Half man, half kangaroo. And who's this in his pouch?
jesse_pinkman His sidekick Joey, he rides around in his pouch and, you know, fights crime.
jane_margolis So that makes Kangaman a she. You know that, right? Only female kangaroos have pouches.
jesse_pinkman Yeah, yeah, I know. But he's definitely a dude. He's a product of experimentation.
jane_margolis He's kind of hot I guess, nice haunches. And this is?
jesse_pinkman It's Backwardo. Wait, no I actually changed it to Rewindo. Anyways, he goes backwards. He can make everything go in reverse.
jane_margolis Time and stuff, like timetravelling?
jesse_pinkman No he just, uh, he just walks backwards.
jane_margolis He walks backwards? Is that a superpower? What good is that?
jesse_pinkman No, he does it like really fast. Okay look, say someone's coming at him with a knife, right, I mean it's helpful that he can just zip backwards away from them.
jane_margolis Okay...
jesse_pinkman Yo, I was a kid when I drew all these. It was like four years ago.
jane_margolis They all look like you.
jesse_pinkman What?
jane_margolis It's you in all of these.
jesse_pinkman Nuh uh, no.
jane_margolis I wonder what a shrink would say if he saw them.
jesse_pinkman Oh, shut up. Like you never wanted a superpower.
jane_margolis Is that your door or mine?
jane_margolis Sounds like mine.
jane_margolis I gotta go.
jesse_pinkman Where? Hey, where? Hey, hold up, where are you?
jesse_pinkman Jane?
donald_margolis Jane.
jane_margolis Hey, Dad.
donald_margolis Oh, there you are. Hi, honey.
donald_margolis I saw your car so I was pretty sure that you were home.
jane_margolis Yeah, sorry, I was working, I had my headphones on.
donald_margolis Finally realized I wasn't the drum track?
jane_margolis Exactly.
donald_margolis Well, I was in the neighborhood, I was wondering if you wanted to grab some lunch.
jesse_pinkman Hey. This, uh, this your dad?
jane_margolis Yes.
donald_margolis *to Jesse* Hello.
jesse_pinkman Hi.
jane_margolis This is the new tenant.
donald_margolis Donald.
jesse_pinkman Jesse.
jane_margolis I'm sorry, did you need something?
jesse_pinkman Uh, no...
jane_margolis Dad, why don't you come in, *to Jesse* it was nice seeing you.
donald_margolis It was nice to meet you.
jesse_pinkman You too.
walter_white_jr Hey, Dad.
walter_white Oh, hey son. Hey, you home early?
walter_white_jr No.
walter_white Oh man. It was a good day?
walter_white_jr Now it is, finally hot water. No more toxic waste.
walter_white Yes. Yes indeed. Top of the line, on demand, unlimited supply.
walter_white_jr Sweet.
walter_white Hey, wanna take her for a spin?
walter_white_jr Oh yeah.
walter_white Okay, listen why don't you go to the kitchen sink, let me know when you're ready and I'll give you a holler. Okay. Pilot in. Ignition, bingo.
walter_white_jr Ready!
walter_white Alright, let her rip!
walter_white Ah, 117,000 BTUs.
walter_white_jr Oh yeah?
walter_white Oh yeah. Built in corrosion draft reducer. Safety thermal couple with the pilot burner.
walter_white_jr Sounds really good, Dad.
walter_white And the energy savings, I mean.
walter_white_jr Ow.
walter_white Oh woah woah, careful, careful. It's probably some adjustments I need to make there. You okay?
walter_white_jr Yeah, I'm fine.
walter_white Okay. Son. About yesterday.
walter_white_jr I'm sorry about the pool.
walter_white No. No, that was not your fault, not at all. See your old man embarrassed himself, I'm not very proud of my behavior and I have to say I feel very foolish.
walter_white_jr You and Uncle Hank. You seemed pissed off.
walter_white No, no. We're fine. Everything's fine. I called him this morning and made my apologies. But son, I owe you an apology most of all. I should've used better judgement all around. Having you drink in the first place, it was not right and for that I'm very sorry.
walter_white_jr But I kept up, right? You and Uncle Hank. I drank three.
walter_white I have some tools to put away.
jane_margolis Hey.
jesse_pinkman Uh, yo.
jane_margolis You wanna catch a movie later?
jesse_pinkman Yo.
jane_margolis What?
jesse_pinkman What was that all about?
jane_margolis What?
jesse_pinkman Before, with your dad.
jane_margolis It wasn't about anything.
jesse_pinkman Oh, okay so I totally misread your total diss.
jane_margolis If anything I was doing you a favor.
jesse_pinkman A favor?
jane_margolis Yeah, I told you, he's a hardass.
jesse_pinkman He seemed cool to me.
jane_margolis Yeah, well.
jesse_pinkman So, what's the deal?
jane_margolis There's no deal, I was helping you out, okay? Protecting you.
jesse_pinkman How's that?
jane_margolis I mean, I'm letting you smoke in here and everything.
jesse_pinkman I bought a filter.
jane_margolis And I figured, the less he knows the better.
jesse_pinkman You acted like you didn't even know me.
jane_margolis So?
jesse_pinkman So.
jane_margolis You think that I'm gonna be like, hey Dad, meet the stoner guy who lives next door and by the way I'm sleeping with him?
jesse_pinkman That's all you think you're doing?
jane_margolis Why do you even care about my dad?
jesse_pinkman I don't.
jane_margolis Good, then I don't even know why we're talking about it.
jesse_pinkman Us. Alright, I'm talking about us.
jane_margolis Us?
jesse_pinkman Yeah. You and me.
jane_margolis Who's you and me?
jesse_pinkman I'm out of here.
walter_white_jr Dad? Dad! Hello!
walter_white What? Oh, hey.
walter_white_jr What are you doing?
walter_white We've got rot.
walter_white_jr Rot?
walter_white Yeah, here. I'll show ya. Here, take a look at that? See that? Ever seen anything like it?
walter_white_jr It's wood.
walter_white It's wood that contains fruiting bodies.
walter_white_jr Fruity what?
walter_white Fungus and it is on a rampage.
walter_white_jr I don't really see anything.
walter_white Well, it's there, you just have to know where to look, here. Then you cut it all out. Just cut it out and start fresh. Well, better get to it.
walter_white_jr Is the whole house gonna collapse or something?
walter_white Not if I can help it.
ted_beneke Hey, bugging for a promotion? Go home already.
skyler_white I will, I will. Hey, umm, can I just ask umm, the Keller account?
ted_beneke Keller account.
skyler_white It's listed as a current asset on this sheet, but the invoice was never presented to accounts receivable, so...
ted_beneke Oh God, one of these days I'm gonna sort through all the dad stuff. He had so many "don't worry about it, pay me Friday" relationships with these companies. Yeah, we'll figure it out tomorrow. Or not. *laughs*
skyler_white Right.
ted_beneke No seriously, you're not gonna make me lock you in are you? Sky? Skyler?
skyler_white Jesus. I'm fine, it's hormones honestly, it happens all the time. I'll see you tomorrow.
ted_beneke What's wrong?
skyler_white I guess it just, doesn't feel any different.
ted_beneke The good news.
skyler_white I mean nothing's really changed, it's just postponed. It was supposed to be a light at the end of the tunnel, but umm, lately it just feels like...
ted_beneke More tunnel.
skyler_white I'm sorry. I just feel so damn ungrateful.
ted_beneke I don't know. For me it was the flu.
skyler_white What?
ted_beneke My dad rallied at the end. I mean it wasn't the fullon good news Walt got, different circumstances, but we were happy, we were over the moon. And uh, back then I got sick. The flu, boom. Knocked me on my ass for days. Couldn't get out of bed, couldn't move. Great timing, huh? And I wasn't even putting two and two together, I was just thinking, why now? Being that rock, you know, being that rock takes everything you've got.
walter_white Ooh. Oh, yeah.
skyler_white Are you going to work today?
walter_white Skyler, there's rot. Going back.
woman#unknown#BreakingBad.Season02.Episode10 Goodnight, Ted.
ted_beneke Goodnight.
skyler_white Oh damn! Mmm, clumsy.
skyler_white No no, Ted, you don't have to do that.
walter_white *to dealer 1* You're buying the wrong matches.
dealer_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season02.Episode10 What?
walter_white Those matches, they're the wrong kind. Red phosphorus is found in the striker strips, not the matches themselves. You need the big 200count box of individual matchbooks. More striker strips, you understand? Those only have the one. And don't buy everything in one place, do it piecemail. Different items, different stores. Attracts less attention. Huh? Are you following me here?
dealer_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season02.Episode10 Hey, there he is. That's the guy.
walter_white Stay out of my territory.

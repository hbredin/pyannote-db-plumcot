dr_barry_goodman Si. Si. Listo.
dr_barry_goodman Vamonos.
dr_barry_goodman Vamonos!
jesse_pinkman In here!
dr_barry_goodman Este. Rapido, rapido!
dr_barry_goodmanjesse_pinkman Hey! Hey! Hey! What about him? What about him?
jesse_pinkman Hey. Someone. Por favor! Assistance! This man needs help!
dr_barry_goodman *speaking of Gus* This man pays my salary.
walter_white 40.23 pounds.
walter_white *to Tyrus* Are they back yet? Have you heard from anyone? If Pinkman is gone, I'm done, do you understand? I quit.
walter_white I just told you, 40.23 pounds.
tyrus_kitt 40.21.
walter_white Look, umm, my brotherinlaw, he keeps talking about driving out to the factory farm and I have, I have stalled him as long as I possibly can, but it's really at the point now where he's just gonna find someone else to take him out there. So I don't know if it's been made presentable yet, but I should be the one to take him out there, right?
walter_white Can you just run it up the chain of command then?
walter_white *to Hank* Anything suspicious?
hank_schrader Still no, Walt.
walter_white Well, then should we go?
hank_schrader You got someplace to be? Cause that's the third time you've asked that.
walter_white No, I'm just curious what the next move is.
hank_schrader Our next three moves is sitting here and waiting. Here's the job, buddy. Ain't all supermodels and speedboats, you know?
walter_white Any Cartel news these days? Seems like I'm always reading something or other in the paper.
hank_schrader Yeah well, not a lot happening stateside. Hear rumblings about some big play down south. Lots of bodies apparently. You know, even by Cartel standards. We'll know more when the buzzards leave the bones. So when are we gonna talk about your face?
walter_white *sighs* I don't wanna get into it, okay?
hank_schrader No, it's not okay. My brotherinlaw shows up looking like Macho Camacho and he thinks we're not gonna discuss it? You know buddy, if you're in over your head on something don't you think I'd be the guy to come to? You know one of my old buddies from Glenco, he had a gambling problem. His thing was scratch cards instead of blackjack. That unlucky bastard. Had his car repoed playing scratchandwins. He's fine now, you know, he got help and all. But I know that he got on a ride that was rough to get off of. I'm just sayin' I'm here, you know, if you want to talk about it.
walter_white I don't want to talk about it to you or to anyone else. I'm done explaining myself.
jesse_pinkman *to Barry* Hey, uh, yo. You think he needs some more blood?
dr_barry_goodman It's in the refrigerator.
jesse_pinkman What you, you want me to uh?
dr_barry_goodman Anegative, yes? Your blood type?
jesse_pinkman Uh, I don't know, maybe.
dr_barry_goodman *laughs* Anegative. Twentyfive years old. Seventy kilo. 180 centimeters. You smoke, you drink, you uh, puff puff puff. But, no disease, no condition, no complication other than an allergy to, oh wait don't sayâ€¦erythromycin. But I have Cefzil in here, so no problem.
jesse_pinkman How do you know all that?
jesse_pinkman Jesus. He thought of everything.
dr_barry_goodman Onegative. That's what he needs.
gustavo_fring It's time to go.
jesse_pinkman What about Mike?
dr_barry_goodman With this injury? Not allowed to travel for at least a week.
gustavo_fring *to Jesse* I'll send for him.
dr_barry_goodman *in Spanish* You need protection, Gustavo?
dr_barry_goodman *in Spanish* I wouldn't have guessed.
gustavo_fring Gracias.
dr_barry_goodman De nada amigo. Buenos suerte. Water. And rest.
gustavo_fring *to Jesse* Vamonos.
jesse_pinkman What happened to the plane?
gustavo_fring There are many good ways south. Unfortunately only one good way north. Six miles to Texas. I've got a man there who'll drive us the rest of the way.
jesse_pinkman I kinda liked the plane. Sure you're gonna make it? Six miles is pretty far.
gustavo_fring I'll make it. You did well down here. And you also proved a point. I think you can run the lab by yourself now. Don't you?
jesse_pinkman Let Mr. White go. Pay him off or fire him, don't kill him.
gustavo_fring You know that won't work.
jesse_pinkman Then you've got a problem.
skyler_white Hi. We're home! *to Junior* You doing your homework?
walter_white_jr Yeah.
skyler_white Uh huh, well dinner is in about thirty.
ted_beneke Hey, sorry to call you at home, but I think that maybe you're not getting my messages. That or you just don't feel like talkin' to me. Anyway, why I've been calling is because that thing we discussed. Well, I've been thinking and I decided I can't do it. I know that's probably not what you wanted to hear, but hopefully you'll understand and if you wanted to talk some more about it that's fine. So call me, I'm around.
ted_beneke Hey.
skyler_white Hi.
ted_beneke Come on in.
ted_beneke Well first. I want to tell you that I get it. From what you told me, this situation with Walt's gambling sounds intense.
skyler_white Yeah, it definitely was. And continues to be, so...I would greatly appreciate it if you would just help me out here.
ted_beneke Well, I have thought long and hard about this and, uh, here's what I wanna do. So is Walt gonna be okay? Are you in contact with him?
skyler_white He's fine.
ted_beneke Good. That's good.
skyler_white No, absolutely not and I mean to keep it that way, so.
skyler_white $617,000 written out to me. Uh, what is this?
ted_beneke I can't take your money.
skyler_white Oh? And why is that?
ted_beneke Because at the end of the day, paying my debt with illicit gambling winnings...I don't know, feels wrong.
skyler_white It feels wrong?
ted_beneke To me it does.
skyler_white Uh huh...
ted_beneke I'm not judging you or Walt, I'm just saying I feel uncomfortable with it.
skyler_white Well, umm, Ted. The whole reason we're in this mess is because you had me cooking your books. So...when did wrong suddenly become a problem for you?
ted_beneke Now hold on, that was a one time measure I took in an honest attempt to protect my employees and save my dad's company. And it might've been a mistake, but that's no reason to go and make another.
skyler_white No, Ted, this is the big mistake right here. You owe the federal government $617,000. If you do not pay them they will come after you and then they will come after me and if they audit my business, find out that Walt and I paid for it with close to a million dollars in untaxed gambling winnings we will go to prison where you will already be. Do you understand?
ted_beneke I understand you're upset, but I think you're overstating things too. No one's going to prison.
skyler_white Oh my God, how are you not following me here?
ted_beneke Okay. Fine. Let's say I take your advice, I pay the IRS, then what?
skyler_white Then you don't owe them, I...
ted_beneke Okay, but I still owe the bank, Skyler. I'm still gonna go bankrupt. I'm gonna lose my business and my home. I'm still gonna have to pull my girls out of school. Just because I pay some stupid fine doesn't make my life any less ruined.
skyler_white So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying you can't take the money I gave you...but you can take a larger amount?
ted_beneke No. I'm just saying, as much as I appreciate the gesture, the money you gave me doesn't really change anything.
skyler_white Because it's not enough?
ted_beneke No, no. Don't twist my words. This isn't about amounts. This is about me doing the right thing.
skyler_white Ted, are you blackmailing me?
ted_beneke What? No? Blackmailing? God...I feel like I'm not explaining things right.
skyler_white I think you're explaining it fine. I noticed that, uh, this is for less than what I gave you by the way.
ted_beneke That's the Mercedes, I leased it before I knew where the money came from.
skyler_white Mmm, and now that you know you'll of course be returning it.
ted_beneke Well, the leases are pretty ironclad so I'll have to see what's possible, but yeah I'm gonna do my best. And I will pay you back as soon as I can.
skyler_white I don't want you to pay me, Ted. I want you to pay them.
skyler_white Try it again. Write a new check.
ted_beneke Skyler.
skyler_white Same amount, only this time make it payable to
ted_beneke What happened to us?
skyler_white Make it payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
ted_beneke I can't.
skyler_white You have to.
ted_beneke Actually, no I don't.
skyler_white Write. It.
skyler_white Saul Goodman, please. Tell him it's important. Yeah.
gustavo_fring Hello Hector.
gustavo_fring All of them, Hector. Don Heladio, Don Paco, Sesal, Ronaldo, Portuno, Cisco and Louise, Escarada. All dead. As is your grandson, Joaquin. Do you know who killed Joaquin? Would you like to see?
gustavo_fring This young man. Do you remember him? That young man shot Joaquin to death while I made my escape. I believe you have met him before. It was just you and Joaquin. He was the only family you had left. Now, the Salamanca name dies with you. Will you look at me now? Look at me, Hector. Look at me.
hank_schrader *to Walt* Hey listen, Walt, really appreciate you doing this you know. I know you guys have your hands filled with the car wash and all.
walter_white No, come on. No worries. Happy to do it. Besides it gives me a chance to see how you work a case, it's interesting.
hank_schrader Yeah right, watching weeds grow, huh? Na this job can be boring as hell...until it's not. *laughs*
walter_white So, umm, any more news on that thing in Mexico?
hank_schrader Eh, same old same old. Bunch of animals clawing each others' eyes out over turf.
walter_white So you think all the victims were Cartel members?
hank_schrader Not in the loop enough to know, listen take a right up here at this street, will you?
walter_white Right? But, uh, we're going to the chicken farm, that's straight ahead?
hank_schrader Well, we're taking a little detour.
walter_white Alright.
hank_schrader Yeah, there's this industrial laundry I wanna check out. It's not far. Yeah turn right here.
walter_white What, what laundry? What about it?
hank_schrader Well it's owned by this company, this Madrigal Electromotive. It's this big German conglomerate, right, into everything. It turns out that it's the same company that owns Fring's chicken joint.
walter_white Sounds like a real shot in the dark there. I mean you said it yourself, right? If this, Madrigal is it? If this is such a big conglomerate then, I mean they must own all kinds of businesses. No, it just sounds kind of thin.
hank_schrader Well look at you. What, you lose your hair, you go on a couple stakeouts, all of a sudden you're what, you're Kojak? *laughs*
walter_white Just sayin'. Now the chicken farm, however, boy that place seems ripe for clandestine activities. I just wouldn't want us to miss anything, you know?
hank_schrader You're gonna talk about clandestine activities? Madrigal Electromotive also owns a subsidiary that manufactures this state of the art air filtration system. And none other than Gale Boetticher took delivery of one of these systems. Yeah, a chemist who was in possession of handdrawn plans for a meth super lab and was visited by none other than Gus Fring just days before he was capped in the face, okay. Shit, startin' to feel like Three Days of the Condor, you know? Anyway, an industrial laundry would be one hell of a place to hide a meth lab. There it is right up there, just turn in there. Walt, slow down, you gotta turn in there Walt. Walt, what are you doing, you just missed it?
walter_white Sorry, it looked like a dirt road, I thought you meant further up.
hank_schrader Just bang a Uie over here.
hank_schrader Mmmm, hits the spot, thanks guys.
walter_white_jr I said to Mom ice cream, but she was like it tastes the same and it's healthier, so. Sorry. I tried
skyler_white Frozen yogurt does taste the same. It tastes exactly the same.
walter_white_jr Wow. I feel, like, sorry for your tastebuds. *laughs* Weigh in here Uncle Hank.
hank_schrader Hey, it's free food. Free food always tastes good. Free drinks even better.
marie_schrader *to Hank* Hey hun, can you handle another visitor?
hank_schrader Ho ho, Mr. Magoo, yeah sure. Hey watch out, don't run into any walls or anything, alright?
walter_white_jr Hey, dad.
walter_white Hey, son. So how ya feelin' Hank?
hank_schrader Oh, you know. Kind of feels like one of those cones they put on dogs so they don't lick their own balls.
marie_schrader Nice. Thank you. Stay classy.
hank_schrader Anyway, hangin' in there. Glad you stopped by.
walter_white Listen, I'm sorry about this. I mean that guy he just came out of nowhere.
hank_schrader Yeah, actually he didn't. I saw him comin' a mile away. Hey, just mark it down as a brain fart and, uh, be thankful no one got killed.
marie_schrader Well, I'll tell you one thing. Your Hardy Boy routine is over. No more asking him to drive you on stakeouts. It's too dangerous.
walter_white_jr I'll do it.
skyler_white Oh no you won't.
hank_schrader Marie's right it was a bit shortsided of me. That's why I caved.
skyler_white Caved?
hank_schrader Yeah I broke down, I ordered me a gimpmobile.
marie_schrader I wish you would stop calling it that.
walter_white What do you mean, like a handivan with a lift?
hank_schrader No no, it's a regular Tahoe, it's got hand controls. I ordered it, should be in here about a week. Don't expect to be in it long, but gotta get around on my own. Stop being such a damn burden to everyone.
skyler_white Oh, sorry, carwash business.
saul_goodman Hey, it's me, can you talk?
skyler_white I can listen.
saul_goodman Fair enough. He doesn't own a gun. At least not one that he bought legally. Nor does his home security system have any kind of panic button arrangements, so way I see it we're good to go. That is if this is still how you wanna handle it.
skyler_white Like I said I don't want anyone hurt, all I want is for him to write a check.
saul_goodman Yup, it's gonna be fine I got my Ateam on it.
ted_beneke Can I help you?
kuby Yeah, thanks.
ted_beneke Woah, woah, you just can't...what's this about?
kuby I'll tell you what this is about Mr. Beneke. This is about you and me doing our best to keep Huell happy. This is Huell. Huell, you happy?
huell Reasonably.
kuby What would make you unhappy.
huell This little mofo not doing what he's told.
kuby And if you were to become unhappy, Mr. Beneke wouldn't care for that?
huell I'm gonna say no.
kuby Well there you have it. Let's go find your checkbook.
kuby Ready? Here we go, alright? We're walking, we're swinging our feet. There you go, very nice. Beautiful place you have here. This way. So, the amount's gonna be for $617,226
ted_beneke Woah, woah. I don't have nearly that kind of money.
kuby Hold that thought. Forgot to mention we know exactly down to the penny how much money is in your checking account, understand? You still wanna say that stuff from before? Maybe not. So, $617,226.31. Made payable to the Internal Revenue Service.
ted_beneke What? Wait this is, uh, Skyler. Skyler White sent you?
kuby Doesn't matter who sent us. For right now, all you have to do is worry about that.
ted_beneke Oh my God, this is a giant misunderstanding. Skyler is a dear friend of mine, alright? Just let me call her and we'll uh...
kuby No. You're misunderstanding, Mr. Beneke. Phone call time is over. It's check writing time.
ted_beneke This is crazy, Skyler would never do this to me.
kuby Sit down and write!
kuby There ya go. $617,226.31. Yeah, right. You got it. Huell, you happy?
kuby Ha ha, Huell's happy! Alright, everything else has been filled out for ya. Alls we need is a signature right there.
kuby Great. Hard part's over. Here's what happens next. Huell's gonna hang with you. I'm gonna make sure I get this down to UPS before five o'clock. On the way back I'm gonna grab some sandwiches. The three of us can hang out, play cards or watch TV or whatever for the next couple of days until the check clears. Painless, right? Unless in case you don't have cable. In which case it's gonna suck, so...
walter_white *to Tyrus* Does the laundry have to be dirty?
tyrus_kitt Nope.
walter_white Someone cooked here.
tyrus_kitt You've been out of commission for four days. Think we're gonna shut down the whole operation just for you?
walter_white Who cooked? Who was here?
jesse_pinkman Now how are you doing all the backflips? Tell me.
brock_cantillo Cheat code.
jesse_pinkman Oh, I'm gonna get you. Oh I'm gonna get you. *tickles Brock and laughs* You're just pressing buttons and it makes you do magical stuff.
brock_cantillo No.
jesse_pinkman Yes, cheater. *Jesse pushes Brock back*
andrea_cantillo Who's winning?
brock_cantillo I am.
jesse_pinkman Well, yeah. Look at you. Look at...
brock_cantillo 101 backflips I did.
jesse_pinkman Oh you, yeah keep it goin'...
andrea_cantillo *to Brock* Oh, you're in trouble. Momma's in the house.
walter_white Jesse.
jesse_pinkman What do you want? I'm busy.
walter_white We need to talk.
jesse_pinkman I got nothing to say to you man.
walter_white Jesse please, I'm sorry. Just one minute, that's all I ask.
jesse_pinkman Get the hell out of my house.
walter_white Come on, hey, come on. Just give me one minute! Let me just explain myself. Okay. Alright, alright, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I know that you have been cooking without me.
jesse_pinkman That's right, so what?
walter_white So what? Isn't it obvious to you what Gus is planning? He's going to use you to replace me. He doesn't think you need me anymore. Jesse. Jesse if you agree to replace me, he will kill me.
jesse_pinkman You brought your brotherinlaw to our lab? What the hell's wrong with you.
walter_white It's not my fault Jesse, just listen. You've gotta help me, please.
jesse_pinkman Last time I asked for your help, you said I hope you end up buried in a barrel in the Mexican desert.
gustavo_fring You are done. Fired. Do not show your face at the laundry again. Stay away from Pinkman. Do not go near him. Ever. Are you listening to me?
walter_white Or else you'll do what?
gustavo_fring What did you say?
walter_white Stay away from Pinkman or else you'll do what? Kill me? If you could kill me, I'd already be dead. But you can't. You can't kill me because Jesse wouldn't cook for you if you did. That's it isn't it? *coughs* No matter how hard you try to turn him against me, to screw with his head so that he would hate my guys and he still won't let you do it.
gustavo_fring For now. But he'll come around. In the meantime there's a matter of your brotherinlaw. He is a problem you promised to resolve. You have failed. Now it's left with me to deal with him.
walter_white You can't.
gustavo_fring If you try to interfere, this becomes a much simpler matter. I will kill your wife. I will kill your son. I will kill your infant daughter.
saul_goodman Great. Perfect, you know, this is just. I told her you were my Ateam.
huell It was an act of God. Ain't no accounting for no act of God.
kuby Check's in the mail at least.
saul_goodman Oh, hello Mrs. White. The good news is the IRS has been paid off, the bad news is...uh, Jesus. Well, here goes nothing.
francesca Hey! Hey!
saul_goodman Woah woah woah! Slow down! What the? How did you hear?
walter_white What? Hear what?
saul_goodman Guys, go go, scram. What the hell happened to you? You...
walter_white Saul, Saul. This man that you spoke of before, this person that you said could disappear me, give me a whole new life and make sure that I'm never found.
saul_goodman Yeah?
walter_white Yeah, I need him. Saul. Gus is gonna murder my whole family.
saul_goodman Oh Christ.
walter_white I need this man now. Saul, now Saul!
saul_goodman Yeah, yeah, you understand there's no coming back from this? You're gonna get new socials, new identities, you can't contact your friends or relatives ever again.
walter_white Uh, yes, yes, I understand.
saul_goodman How are you gonna sell this to that wife of yours and your teenage son?
walter_white I have got no choice.
saul_goodman You're wanted by some pretty scary individuals, not to mention the law. You're a highrisk client. You're gonna need the deluxe service, it's gonna cost you.
walter_white How much?
saul_goodman The last quote I got on the deluxe was 125 grand. But you got four people to vanish, it's gonna be at least half a million and he accepts cash only.
walter_white I've got the money, now come on. Please!
saul_goodman Here.
walter_white Okay. What? This is a vacuum cleaner repair company!
saul_goodman What'd you expect? Haji's Quick Vanish? I don't even know the guy's name. You just call that number and you leave a message, you tell them that you need a new dust filter for a hoover max extract pressure pro model sixty, I wrote it right on there. He'll call you back in five minutes.
walter_white Okay, okay fine. And how long does it take for him to arrange?
saul_goodman The guy works fast, I mean that's the game here. You gotta have your family packed and ready to go before you make the call. He'll tell you where to meet him. He'll put you up in a safehouse until everything is correct, but you gotta bring the money. He doesn't lift a finger unless he's paid in full.
walter_white Okay, Saul...
saul_goodman Can't say it's been a pleasure, but it
walter_white I need you to do one more thing for me. You need to call the DEA and you need to tell them that Gus has a hit out on Hank. No you have to do it for me.
saul_goodman Buddy, I gotta go on living here. No I'm way too comfortable in my way to imagine
walter_white Just call anonymously, then.
saul_goodman You call anonymously!
walter_white I can't, I can't! I'm practically in the DEA family. I go to their Christmas parties for Christ sake. They know me, they'll know my voice. Please, you gotta do it for me, I'm beggin' ya. Please. My brotherinlaw doesn't deserve to die because of this.
saul_goodman There's no way I'm mentioning Gus.
walter_white Okay.
saul_goodman The most I'll go...I'll say it's the cartel. They're coming back to finish the job that they botched.
walter_white You say whatever you have to say. Just give me an hour to...I need to collect my wife and kids, okay? Just give me an hour and then you make the phone call. Don't forget. Please.
saul_goodman Yeah.
walter_white Thank you, Saul.
walter_white No no no no. Where's the rest? It's not enough. It's not enough.
skyler_white Walt?
walter_white Down here.
skyler_white Walt, what did that phone call mean?
walter_white Where is it? Where's the rest?
skyler_white What?
walter_white The money, Skyler, where is the rest? Skyler. Where is the money?!
skyler_white I gave it to Ted.
walter_white What? You did what?
skyler_white Walt. I had to. For us, for the family. I swear, Walt.
walter_white You gave our money to Beneke?
skyler_white Walt. Please, please, just hear me out. Please.
skyler_white Walt. Walt. Walt.
skyler_white *on answering machine* Hi, you've reached the White family, please leave a message.
marie_schrader *on answering machine* Skyler. It's happening again. The DEA called, they got some tip from an informant. The cartel, they wanna kill Hank. Oh God. They're sending agents to our house right now to guard us. God. When is this going to end?
skyler_white Marie, I'm here. I'm here. Tell me exactly what happened.

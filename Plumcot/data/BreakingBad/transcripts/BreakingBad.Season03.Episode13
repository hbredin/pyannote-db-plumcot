realtor Well, hello again.
skyler_white Hi, I hope we’re not too late.
realtor No, no. Perfect timing.
skyler_white Okay. Stan, this is my husband Walt.
walter_white Hi.
realtor Good to meet you, Walt.
walter_white Nice to meet you.
realtor Sandia Laboratories, huh?
walter_white Yeah.
realtor I hear some pretty fascinating stuff goes on out there.
walter_white Yeah, well, you know...
realtor Working on anything you can talk about? I’m picturing giant space lasers. Am I right?
walter_white what I do would bore you senseless. Giant space lasers? Now that sounds cool. I’ll have to bring it up at our next staff meeting.
realtor Well, just remember I get a cut!
walter_white Alright. It’s a deal.
skyler_white So... this is it, honey. Whaddya say? Do you wanna take a tour
walter_white Sure.
realtor Uh, look. How about, uh, I give ya’ll some privacy? I’ll, uh, go out to the car, make a few calls, and uh... take as much time as you need.
skyler_white Okay, thanks.
skyler_white He’s actually a nice guy. He doesn’t push.
walter_white Yeah.
skyler_white So, as you can see, there’s a kinda flow going on here. It’s a nice big living room. And this is the dining area.
walter_white Ah, the dining “area.” Right.
skyler_white Oh, and uh... it’s got a pool...
walter_white Pool is nice. Backyard could be a little bigger.
skyler_white And oh, there’s uh, a breakfast bar kinda dealie here, which is nice. And um, the kitchen’s really spacious, and you know... got good appliances.
walter_white How many bedrooms?
skyler_white Three. Told you. They’re all pretty good size. Oh, and this is the first one here. And there’sthere’s two more at the back.
walter_white Only three bedrooms? I think we’re gonna need at least five, don't you think?
skyler_white Five? What, do I look like I’m about to drop a litter?
walter_white Nonononono. We’ll have three kids total, eventually. You know, but well need a spare room for a study so that I can work at home and you can write. Yeah, nah. I don’t think this is gonna be enough.
skyler_white Okay, um, about a wine cellar? I mean, we certainly cannot be expected to live without a wine cellar.
walter_white Very funny. I just think we need to set our sights high is all. At least higher then here.
skyler_white Walt, this is a good neighborhood. It’s got a good elementary, and supposedly a very good high school. And believe me, cause I have definitely looked everywhere for our price range, this is as good as it gets.
walter_white Well, then, let’s stretch our price range. Truly. I mean why buy a starter house when we’ll have to move out of in a year or two.
skyler_white Did you win the lottery and not tell me?
walter_white I’m serious. Come on.... why be cautious? We’ve got nowhere to go but up.
walter_white Yeah.
mike_ehrmantraut Walter, you see us?
walter_white Yeah. I see you.
mike_ehrmantraut I’d like you to exit your vehicle and start walking toward us.
walter_white And then what? I’m gonna need some... some kind of assurance.
mike_ehrmantraut I assure you I could kill you from way over here, if it makes you feel any better.
mike_ehrmantraut Walter. You’ve been busy. You wanna put your arms out to your sides for me, if you would.
mike_ehrmantraut You know I haven’t slept since Thursday? I was out all night cleaning up after you. I need my sleep.
walter_white You said no half measures.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah? Funny how words can be so open to interpretation.
mike_ehrmantraut You get your car fixed?
walter_white Not yet.
mike_ehrmantraut You’re gonna wanna get your car fixed.
walter_white Let’s see how this goes first.
gustavo_fring Has your condition worsened?
walter_white Excuse me?
gustavo_fring Your medical condition. Has it grown worse?
walter_white Not that I know of, no.
gustavo_fring Is there a ringing in your ears? Are you seeing bright lights, or hearing voices?
walter_white I’m quite well, thank you.
gustavo_fring No, clearly you’re not. No rational person would do as you have done. Explain yourself.
walter_white My partner was about to get himself shot. I intervened.
gustavo_fring Some worthless junkie. For him, you intervene and put us all at risk. Some contemptible junkie who couldn’t keep the peace for eight hours.
walter_white That’s right. He couldn’t. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven yearold boy.
gustavo_fring I heard about it. He should have let me take care of them.
walter_white Maybe. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.
gustavo_fring Are you asking me if I ordered the murder of a child?
walter_white I would never ask you that.
gustavo_fring Where is Pinkman now?
walter_white I wouldn’t know.
walter_white A couple of time zones away, at least. Beyond that, I’d only be guessing. He has enough money to last forever, and he knows to keep moving. You’ll never find him.
mike_ehrmantraut I dunno, Walt. It’s what I do, after all.
walter_white He’s out of the picture. I saved his life I owed him that. But now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted, isn’t it?
walter_white You’ve always struck me as a very pragmatic man. So if I may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me, you have two. Option A you kill me right here and now. Apparently I have made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses, and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him, too. A pointless exercise it seems to me, but that is Option A.
gustavo_fring What is Option B?
walter_white I continue cooking. You and I both forget about Pinkman. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B.
gustavo_fring You’d need a new assistant.
walter_white I could get right on that.
gustavo_fring No. This time I choose.
mike_ehrmantraut Your car. Get it fixed.
walter_white Yeah.
walter_white It’s good to see you.
gale_boetticher Thanks. It’s good to be back. Well, Shall we?
walter_white By all means, Gale. Let’s cook
mike_ehrmantraut What about that rhinoceros? You think he’d make a good pet?
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 No!
mike_ehrmantraut No? Don’t you think if you called to him, he’d come running for his supper? I’ll bet he would.
mike_ehrmantraut I’ll bet he’d come running BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 You’re silly PopPop.
mike_ehrmantraut Well... a little. But he’d probably knock everything over. Plus, there’s that big nose of his.
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 That’s not a nose, that’s a horn.
mike_ehrmantraut Is that so?
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 His real nose is little.
mike_ehrmantraut Huh. I learn all kinds of things being with you.
mike_ehrmantraut Okay, Junebug, these are for you?
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 What about the rest?
mike_ehrmantraut The rest are for me.
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 No, they’re not. You’re too old for balloons.
mike_ehrmantraut Oh, you’re never too old for balloons.
mike_ehrmantraut Give me a hug. I see your Mom. Don’t keep her waiting.
granddaughter#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 Bye, PopPop!
mike_ehrmantraut Bye, baby.
mexican_man_1#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 What do you think?
mexican_man_2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 Only one way to find out.
mexican_man_2#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 What was that?
secretary#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode13 Please... please...
mexican_man_3#unknown#BreakingBad.Season03.Episode133 AAAAAAAAAAAGGGHH!
mike_ehrmantraut Chow. You have anything you wanna tell me?
duane_chow Thank God you’re here! They keep me prisoner!
mike_ehrmantraut They keep you prisoner.
duane_chow I don’t do nothing for them ever! They try and make me, I say no! They steal my chemicals? I can’t stop them! I am businessman!
mike_ehrmantraut You’re a businessman. The lady out front, Hey lady, are you still there? Ask her if she’s still there.
duane_chow Peng, are you still there?
duane_chow She says yes.
mike_ehrmantraut How’s her driving?
mike_ehrmantraut Driving. Is she good behind the wheel?
duane_chow Good. She’s good driver.
mike_ehrmantraut Licensed? Dependable?
duane_chow She has a Camry.
mike_ehrmantraut Good.
mike_ehrmantraut The trucks’ll be here first thing in the morning. I strongly recommend that you return our calls next time. So..? Have her drive you to the hospital.
mike_ehrmantraut She’s gonna need her shoe.
gustavo_fring Where did they cross?
mike_ehrmantraut Laredo, looks like. They didn’t exactly send their “A” players. But like you said, it’s cartel, alright.
gustavo_fring Probing for weakness.
mike_ehrmantraut Well. They didn’t find any.
gustavo_fring What about Pinkman?
mike_ehrmantraut I’m making inquiries.
walter_white That’s two. Alright, let’s close it up.
walter_white Alright, bring it down. Ready? Okay, we’re good
walter_white You can take your mask off now.
gale_boetticher Does that guy ever leave..
gale_boetticher When exactly did that start?
walter_white It’s new. We had a little drama with the person you replaced.
gale_boetticher Sorry to hear that.
walter_white Nah, nah. it’ll fine. Things’ll continue to smooth out and... yeah. It’ll be fine.
gale_boetticher By the way, if you’re at all worried about working with me...
walter_white No. I’m not.
gale_boetticher whatever my shortcomings last time, I intend for things to go perfectly from here on out. So if there’s...
walter_white Gale, you’re great. Seriously.
gale_boetticher I just, however you like things to be done, is exactly how we’re going to do them. Period. From here on out. So Please. Teach me.
walter_white Okay.
gustavo_fring Gale. It’s good to see you.
gale_boetticher Mr. Fring. Wow, this is, uh...
gustavo_fring I should have called first. I’m not interrupting anything, am I?
gale_boetticher No, not at all. Please, come in!
gale_boetticher Can I offer you something? A creme de menthe?
gustavo_fring Oh, no, no, thank you. I’m sorry for the inconvenience
gale_boetticher Oh, no, no. It’s no inconvenience.
gustavo_fring I need to talk to you about something. Something rather pressing.
gustavo_fring If push came to shove, I was wondering how soon you might be able to take over the lab yourself. You, and an assistant.
gale_boetticher Why would... Why would push come to shove?
gustavo_fring Has Walter ever talked to you about why he got into this particular line of work?
gale_boetticher Uh... I guess I assumed it’s because it pays so well.
gustavo_fring Oh, it is. But specifically, has he ever spoken to you about his health problems? I’m not surprised. He’s a very private person.
gale_boetticher What exactly are his health problems?
gustavo_fring He’s dying of cancer. It is why he does this. To provide for his family. Which he’s accomplished. They will never want for anything he’s seen to that.
gale_boetticher Oh... how long does he have?
gustavo_fring That is very much the question. He does not want to talk about it. And every time I bring it up with him... I don’t know that he’s fully
gale_boetticher No, I understand...
gustavo_fring I have a very large investment in this. There’s so much overhead that I can’t afford to shut down. Not
gale_boetticher I do. Absolutely.
gustavo_fring Now, I intend to keep Walter on for as long as he wants, assuming he’s physically up to it. But as he cannot or will not tell me how long
gale_boetticher Worstcase scenario... Uh, I suppose if we had at least a few more cooks together.
gustavo_fring You don’t think you’re ready now?
gale_boetticher Well, he is such a, a master. There’s always more for me to learn. But I’m thinking that if we had say... one or two more cooks
gale_boetticher One more, I guess, would do it. I suppose.
gustavo_fring I believe in you, Gale. I know that when the time comes, you will be ready.
walter_white What’s up?
gale_boetticher Walt. Is there, um...
gale_boetticher ...any particular trick to purging the catalyst bed?
walter_white No, it’s pretty straightforward. I’ll show you when we get there.
saul_goodman Yeah? Tell him I’m in conference.
saul_goodman Can’t you see I’m in conference?
mike_ehrmantraut I’m looking to find a client of yours. I was hoping you could help me out with an address.
saul_goodman Which client?
mike_ehrmantraut Jesse Pinkman.
saul_goodman JessePinkmanInThePhoneBook, Jesse Pinkman? Hmm, how would one track him down, I wonder?
saul_goodman You’re still here?
mike_ehrmantraut I’m gonna need your full attention, Saul. Jesse Pinkman. Current whereabouts. The sooner you tell me, the sooner you can get back to whatever the hell this is exactly.
saul_goodman What am I, eighthgrade hall monitor? “Current whereabouts?” Let me tell you something, Mike
mike_ehrmantraut Whoa. You are good right there. Let’s both get comfortable.
mike_ehrmantraut Now, when I say I’m looking for Pinkman, we both know why. Don’t we? And you pretending otherwise only wastes my time and serves to annoy me.
saul_goodman Look, Mike... there are rules to this lawyer thing.
mike_ehrmantraut Is that right?
saul_goodman SAUL Yeah. “Attorneyclient privilege?” I mean, that’s a big one! And that’s something I provide for you! So, if I give up Pinkman... well, then you’re gonna be asking “old Saul gives ‘em up pretty easy. What’s to keep him from giving me up?” You see? So, then, where’s the trust?
mike_ehrmantraut I trust the hole in the desert I’d leave you in.
saul_goodman Yeah... that’s an argument.
mike_ehrmantraut Saul, don’t make me beat you till your legs don’t work. Now tell me where to find him. You know it’s the right thing.
saul_goodman I can’t tell you, Mike. Alright? If I was to tell you, well I just... I couldn’t live with myself. I’m sorry.
saul_goodman But who’s to say I didn’t write the address down in my dayplanner?
saul_goodman Or on a scratch piece of paper... somewhere. Who’s to say I didn’t write down a location? Strictly for my own professional use.
saul_goodman Do NOT touch anything on my desk. I’m gonna leave the room... uh, make myself a Nescafe.
saul_goodman I’m just looking out for you, that’s all. I’m like a mother hen.
saul_goodman Believe me, moneylaundering ain’t what it used to be. God, do I miss the 80s.
walter_white You’re wasting your time I’m buying the car wash. End of story.
saul_goodman Well, one look at this place, you’re gonna fall in love.
saul_goodman Huh? Was I right? Where else you gonna find a cashonly business that’s this much fun? Unless we’re talking massage parlor, and, uh... I don’t see it! Shall we?
saul_goodman Shall we?
saul_goodman You ever actually play laser tag? You know... it’s good cardio. Plus you get to shoot at kids...
saul_goodman You got your bumper cars over there down that way. Got your arcade right here all the latest video games. Snack bar’s over there. Nothing stopping you from selling beer to the parents. That’s a whole new revenue stream...
walter_white Alright, alright, alright already. We’rewe’re good.
saul_goodman Holy Christ.
saul_goodman “We’re GOOD?” This constitutes “good” where you’re from? My car is bugged.
walter_white I said maybe. Maybe bugged.
saul_goodman I’m being followed?! What the hell have you gotten me into? I got my very own PI threatening to break my legs! That’s like Thomas Magnum threatening, that, that Little prissy guy with the mustache. Over and above. Servicewise, this is over and above. You and I survive this? Oh, I’m seriously rethinking my pricing. Yeah. And that goes double for you, HipHop!
saul_goodman My guy’s no dummy, right? So, I give us maybe twentyfour hours before he figures out that address goes nowhere. You guys do your thing, make it snappy. I’ll go... see if they have Tetris or something.
walter_white How you holding up?
jesse_pinkman You..?
walter_white I got my old job back. At least, until they kill me, and Gale takes over.
jesse_pinkman So, he’s their boy, huh?
walter_white He’s their boy.
jesse_pinkman How long you think you’ve got?
walter_white Well, he asks a lot of questions about the cooking process. I try to be as vague as possible, but I’ve got that guy Victor watching me, listening to every word I say... You know it may be that the only thing saving me is Gale’s fastidiousness. Once he feels confident that he knows my entire method...
jesse_pinkman So, what do we do?
walter_white You know what we do.
jesse_pinkman There’s got to be some other way. Maybe it’s better for you to just go to the cops, alright? I mean, I can’t believe I’m saying that and all. But for your family? I mean, the DEA would love you all the shit you could tell them? Federal witness protection, that’s a good deal. As for me? I’ll hit the road, yo. I’ll make it. We had a, we had a good run. But it’s over.
walter_white Never the DEA. The cook can’t stop. That’s the one thing I’m certain of production cannot stop. Gus can’t afford to. So, if I’m the only chemist that he’s got... then I’ve got leverage. And leverage keeps me alive. It keeps you alive, too. I think I can see to that. IF I’m the only chemist that he’s got.
jesse_pinkman I can’t do it, Mr. White. Like you said, I’mI’m not a... I can’t do it.
walter_white I’ll do it. I’m gonna need your help. I mean, they’re watching me day and night. They never leave me alone with Gale, not for a moment. Hell, I don’t even know where the man lives. He’s not in the phone book, I can’t find him on the Internet. I can’t do it in the lab. Victor’s always there. But if I could just shake Victor, for even an hour one night, I think then that I may be able to make it look like an accident.
jesse_pinkman There’s got to be some other way.
walter_white I’m all ears. But when it comes down to you and me versus him? I’m sorry. I’m truly sorry, but it’s gonna be him. And you are the only edge that I’ve got, as long as they don’t know that you’re in town. But I need you to track him. Get me his address. And I’ll do the rest. Look, I saved your life, Jesse. Are you gonna save mine?
jesse_pinkman Yeah.
walter_white Please tell me you found him.
jesse_pinkman Sixtythree fiftythree Juan Tabo Boulevard. Apartment six.
jesse_pinkman You there..?
walter_white Yeah. Sixtythree fiftythree Juan Tabo, number six. Got it. He’s home?
jesse_pinkman Yep.
walter_white Anyone watching the place?
jesse_pinkman No. Looks pretty much wideopen. When you gonna do it?
walter_white Tonight. Once it gets dark.
jesse_pinkman Don’t do this, Mr. White. Please? Go to the cops.
victor We got a problem. There’s some kinda chemical leaking in your lab. You gotta come with me.
walter_white I’ll, uh... I’ll follow you.
victor They tell me to bring you, I bring you. come on, get in the car.
mike_ehrmantraut I don’t know if it’s a barrel leak or what but you got something mighty stinky down there. After you.
mike_ehrmantraut Walter. The sooner you figure out what this is, the sooner we all go home.
walter_white Please don’t do this. Mike..? You don’t have to do this.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah, unfortunately, I do, Walter. Downstairs.
walter_white I’ll cook, I’ll cook for free! And there won’t be any more trouble! I promise you. If I could just talk to Gus, I know I can make him understand! Please! If I can talk to Gus, I can convince him...
mike_ehrmantraut No... no...
walter_white Just let me, please. Please?! Please let me talk to him!
mike_ehrmantraut Shut up. Shut up. I can’t do it. I’m sorry.
walter_white I’ll give you Jesse Pinkman. Okay? Like you said, he’s the problem! He’s ALWAYS been the problem! Without him, we would And he’she’s in TOWN, alright?! He’s not in Virginia or wherever the hell you’re looking for him he’s right here in Albuquerque! And I can take you to him! I’ll take you RIGHT TO him! Huh? What do you say..?
mike_ehrmantraut Where is he right now? You give me an address.
walter_white I don’t... He moves, he moves around. But if you let me call him. No, no... please. I just, my phone, it’s just my phone. I’ll call him and have him meet me. Alright? Okay? Okay?
jesse_pinkman Did you do it..? Mr. White? Did you do it?
walter_white No. I didn’t do it. I can’t now. It’s gonna have to be you.
jesse_pinkman What? No WAY, man!
walter_white Listen to me. You’re closer than we are. You’ll have about a twenty minute lead. They’ve got me at the laundry and they’re gonna kill me. Jesse, do
victor Son of a BITCH!
mike_ehrmantraut Now, just what the hell was that, exactly?
walter_white You might wanna hold off.
mike_ehrmantraut Yeah? Why?
walter_white Because your boss is gonna need me. Sixtythree fiftythree Juan Tabo, apartment six.
walter_white Yeah.
gale_boetticher Hi. How can I help you?
gale_boetticher Oh, oh um
gale_boetticher Take whatever you want. I have money, I’ve got a lot of money...I have, um...
gale_boetticher Please don’t do this. You don’t, you... you, you don’t have to do this.

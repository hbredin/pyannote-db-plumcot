walter_white *to Carol* Hello, Carol!
carol Oh, hi Walt!
marie_schrader Europe. I can't believe it, were you there when she said that?
hank_schrader Yeah.
marie_schrader You okay? Your stomach okay?
hank_schrader Yeah, oh yeah, I'm fine.
marie_schrader Okay. God, Jesus, Europe. I just. And you know where they were three or four months ago. She was talking about, I guess a second honeymoon. We need to go to Europe. We could go.
hank_schrader Yeah.
marie_schrader We could go on a business trip, we could um...go to Italy...
marie_schrader Hank. Hank. Hank? You okay? Hank!
marie_schrader Oh my God, Hank! Hank. Hank! Oh my God! Hank, no, are you okay?
marie_schrader *to the man* Call the ambulance! Call an ambulance! *to Hank* It's okay, take a breath.
hank_schrader It's an accident, it happens.
marie_schrader I'll make the appointment, all you've gotta do is show up.
hank_schrader For what? Three hours in the emergency room, all for nothing.
marie_schrader All they did was rule out a heart attack. What if it happens again?
hank_schrader It's not gonna happen again.
marie_schrader How can you know that? You couldn't even say what it was in the first place.
hank_schrader Marie, baby, I'm fine. Trust me. Discussion over. Do not tell Skyler.
marie_schrader What, why?
hank_schrader Just don't.
marie_schrader There's nothing to be embarrassed about, Hank...Hank!
walter_white Hola, Mariano. Louise. Enrique, ooh, feliz cumpleaños, Enrique!
skyler_white *to Walt* Hi.
walter_white *to Skyler* Hi...okay.
skyler_white *to customer* Have a good day.
walter_white Air fresheners are high margin, right?
skyler_white At thirty cents wholesale, yeah.
walter_white Right. So I'm thinking we reorganize the display. Separate the food scents from the nature scents, I mean, does bubble gum belong anywhere near ocean spray? No. And pine is still our biggest seller, right? So maybe we move that over to the cash register by the 5hour Energy drink.
skyler_white Sure, that's fine.
walter_white Yeah, yeah. *pulling Skyler to the side* Come here. Speaking of the business. The story comes first. The story is that we are car wash owners pure and simple. But, if our story is that the car wash is successful, what do successful car wash owners do? They buy more car washes. Listen, Skyler, we'll be laundering that money for years. Decades. Wouldn't two be better than one?
skyler_white Well there's General Hands over by Kirkland, I do love that location. I'll think about it.
walter_white Yeah, right, right. To be continued.
skyler_white *to Lydia* Good morning, welcome to A1.
lydia_rodartequayle Just the regular, please.
skyler_white Well, we're having a special on hand wax. $21.99 if you're interested in getting rid of those water spots.
lydia_rodartequayle Just the regular is fine.
skyler_white Okay. Well there's complimentary coffee inside while you're waiting. Have an A1 day.
walter_white *to customer* Please give this to your car wash professional and have an A1 day.
lydia_rodartequayle *to Walt* 68% and falling.
walter_white Good morning, may I have your ticket, please?
lydia_rodartequayle I knew there would be a drop in quality, but 68%? This is not what I agreed to.
walter_white I left a viable operation, the rest was up to you. May I have your ticket, please?
lydia_rodartequayle I'm only asking for a few days. A week at most. Call it a tutorial.
walter_white That's the standard wash.
lydia_rodartequayle Fix this. Get the ship back on course. We'll make it worth your while.
walter_white That'll be $14.95, please.
lydia_rodartequayle Listen. This is a complicated situation, there are a lot of moving parts.
walter_white None of which are my concern.
lydia_rodartequayle You're putting me in a box here. You know what could happen.
walter_white Again, none of my concern. There's your change and if you'll hand this to your car wash professional and have an A1 day.
lydia_rodartequayle Listen
walter_white It'll only be a few more minutes, there's some complimentary coffee if you like.
walter_white What's up?
skyler_white Just wondering who washes a rental car. Walt, who was that?
walter_white She's a former business associate who wants me to go back and I won't.
skyler_white *to Enrique* Enrique, this one's finished. Terminado, gracias. *to Lydia* Get out of here. Now.
lydia_rodartequayle Excuse me?
skyler_white Never come back here. Do you understand me?
lydia_rodartequayle I
skyler_white Go!
dea_agent_scott Morning, Mrs. Schrader.
marie_schrader Hey guys, what's going on?
dea_agent_artie Just dropping these off, ma'am. Where'd you like 'em?
hank_schrader Bring 'em around to the garage, guys. *to Marie* I got it. Have a good day.
marie_schrader You too...
dea_agent_scott Boss, Janice said to tell you a few of them might not have indexes. We could give you a hand sorting through 'em?
hank_schrader No I got it, thanks.
dea_agent_artie See you, boss.
hank_schrader Okay.
dea_agent_scott *as the garage door closes on them* Okay, uh...
badger Dude, you are tripping! I'm not dead. I'm on the starship enterprise macking on Yeoman Rand while the Andori with the disrupter's back on Talice 4 or whatever.
skinny_pete What do you think all those sparkles and shit are? The transporters are breaking you apart man, down to your molecules and bones. They're making a copy. That dude who comes out on the other side? He's not you. He's a colored Xerox.
badger So you're telling me every time Kirk went into the transporter he was killing himself? So over the whole series there was like 147 Kirks?
skinny_pete At least. Dude, yo, why do you think McCoy never likes to beam nowhere? Cause he's a doctor, bitch. Look it up, it's science.
badger I ever tell you about my Star Trek script?
skinny_pete Star Trek script?
badger Yeah, I gotta write it down is all! The Enterprise is five parsecs out of Rigel XII. Nothing's going on, neutral zone is quiet, the crew is bored. So they put on a pieeating contest. The whole crew's in the galley, they're eating tullaberry pies.
skinny_pete Tullaberry?
badger Tullaberries! From Gamma Quadrant.
skinny_pete That's Voyager, dude!
badger Okay, blueberries then. They're eating blueberry pies...
skinny_pete Better.
badger As fast as the replicator can churn them out. *makes replicator noise* Finally, it's down to just three. Kirk, Spock, and Chekov, okay. Spock always wins these things.
skinny_pete How's Spock gonna beat Kirk, yo? Spock's like a toothbrush, look at Kirk, he's got room to spare.
badger Spock has total Vulcan control over his digestion! You wanna hear this or not?
skinny_pete Yeah, yeah, go.
badger Okay, finally, Kirk, he can't take it anymore. He yorks! Now it's just down to Chekov and Spock. But Chekov, you see. He's got a whole fat stack of quatloos riding on this. And he has figured out a way to win. He's got Scotty back in the transporter room locked in on Chekov's stomach. Every time Chekov eats a pie, Scotty beams it right out of him.
skinny_pete Where's he sending them, the toilet?
badger Space!
skinny_pete Ohh!!
badger There's blueberries just floating out there, frozen, because it's in space. And Chekov is just shoveling them into his mouth and Spock's like, "I can't believe this Russian is defeating me," meanwhile Scotty's in the transporter room fiddling with levers when Lieutenant Uhura comes in. And she's got, you know, her big pointies and Scotty's fingers are all sweaty...
skinny_pete No!
badger Chekov screams! He sprays blood out of his mouth! Scotty beamed his guts into space!
skinny_pete No way!
badger Hey, where are you going? You're missing the best part!
francesca *to man with broken neck* Just fill this out. Bring it back to me.
jesse_pinkman *to Francesca* Yo. Yo!
huell You know you can't smoke that up in here.
francesca Yeah, Jesse Pinkman's out here smoking pot?
huell Give me a break, man.
francesca *over intercom* Pinkman? He'll see you now.
saul_goodman Woody Harrelson live and in person. Pull up a bong and take a seat, hey I'm kidding about the bong, dude, don't be doing that. Uh, sorry to keep you on ice out there, kid. If I'd known it was you...well Francesca, I warned her before. One more time and it's back to the DMV. So uh, are we on our own today?
masseuse#unknown#BreakingBad.Season05.Episode09 *to Saul* Barn door open.
saul_goodman Barn door? *looks down at pants* Oh. *zips up pants* So, uh, how is the maestro? Things have been quiet on this end.
jesse_pinkman Haven't seen him.
saul_goodman Just as well. Probably. After that whole thing in the jails...when they start to whack the lawyers, that's where I start to draw the line.
jesse_pinkman This goes to Kaylee Ehrmantraut and that goes to Mr. and Mrs. Albert Sharp. 315 East Web Roads up in Whitehorse. Two and a half million each. Total of five.
saul_goodman Mr. and Mrs. who?
jesse_pinkman Drew Sharp's parents.
saul_goodman Drew Sharp, that's the kid on TV, missing, uh...why would you? Scratch that, I don't know and I don't wanna know. The thing is, what those folks want is to know what happened to their boy. Sack full of cash on their doorstep, that's just gonna raise more questions. Kaylee Ehrmantraut, that's Mike's granddaughter? So this is Mike's money?
jesse_pinkman It's mine.
saul_goodman It's your money? Okay. And you're giving it to Kaylee Ehrmantraut...?
jesse_pinkman It's what Mike wanted.
saul_goodman So you and Mike, uh, you've been in touch? So we're just talking about charity? Okay, look, you know uh, shelling out money to the ex and her little boy, I kinda get it. I mean, kinda. But this, this is a bridge too far. I'm sorry to say, kid, but you're still gonna be two miracles short of sainthood.
saul_goodman Brass tacks, okay, my job is to advise and my advice is come on, already. Mike left one step ahead of the boys in blue and you better believe his family's on the radar. Couple million bucks shows up, they're gonna snatch it, tout suite. The feds have already taken Kaylee's money twice. What are you, you're going for a hat trick?
jesse_pinkman I'll fricken do it myself, Saul.
jesse_pinkman Enough bullshit, Saul, are you gonna do this or not?
saul_goodman Yes, yes, absolutely. I live to serve. And kid, uh, you might wanna think about cleaning up a little, getting some rest. You've looked better!
jesse_pinkman Just get it done.
saul_goodman You know who this is? Don't hang up on me. Yeah, there's a problem, there's five million of them here in my office.
walter_white No, no, don't. Just hold onto it. Yes. Yes. Calm down. I'll handle it.
jesse_pinkman It's like you said, it's blood money.
walter_white I s…okay, yes, I said that. I did. But it was in the heat of the moment, I was trying to win an argument, alright? And I was wrong. This is your money. Come on, you've earned it.
walter_white Drew Sharp. That is a terrible memory, no doubt about it. But son, you need to stop focusing on the darkness behind you. The past is the past. Nothing can change what we've done. But now, that's over. You're out and so am I.
walter_white That's right, I'm done. I've been out for about a month. But there is nothing left for us to do except to try to live...ordinary, decent lives.
walter_white Why Kaylee Ehrmantraut?
jesse_pinkman She needs someone looking after her.
walter_white Mike is perfectly capable of looking after his own granddaughter.
jesse_pinkman I don't think so. I don't think he is capable. I don't think he's coming back.
walter_white What are you saying?
jesse_pinkman You doing what you did, offing Mike's guys. If he was out there, you'd have to look after your shoulder the rest of your life and that's not how you do things, so I think he's dead and I think you know that.
walter_white I don't know that. I don't! Listen to me. I did not kill Mike. The last time that I saw him, he had his bag the one that I brought him. And he got in his car and drove away. For all I know he is alive and well. And if...if he does come back and he doesn't understand why I had to do what I did, well then that's on me. Jesse. I need you to believe me. It's not true, it's just not.
jesse_pinkman So he's out there. He's okay.
walter_white Yes. Mike is fine, wherever he is. We both know that he can take care of himself. And he's certainly capable to provide for his own family. Jesse. I need you to believe me.
jesse_pinkman Yeah. Like you said. He's alive.
walter_white Yeah. Mike's alive. Absolutely.
skyler_white Well, you've gotta have a college counselor, are they bringing in someone new?
walter_white_jr I don't know. Maybe she'll be back.
skyler_white Well if she's not, what are you supposed to do? I mean, what's Louis gonna do?
walter_white_jr He's not worried.
skyler_white Oh yeah, sure. What's there to worry about, it's only college, right?
walter_white Right. College, nothing more important.
skyler_white Oh. You know, Uncle Hank's still not feeling well, so bowling is off tonight.
walter_white_jr Really?
skyler_white Really. So you're spared a night out with the family. You do not have to look so happy about it.
walter_white *leaving the table* I'll be right back.
walter_white_jr Umm, so...if bowling's off, can I get a late curfew?
skyler_white Are you gonna turn off the light?
walter_white Have you seen *Leaves of Grass*?
skyler_white Hmm?
walter_white My book. Walt Whitman. Dark green hardcover?
skyler_white I didn't even know we had that.
walter_white Hmm...you don't think Junior?
skyler_white You're kidding, right?
walter_white Well, it'll show up.
walter_white What's wrong with Hank?
skyler_white It's a stomach bug, sounds like. He hasn't been to work all week. Well, goodnight.
walter_white Goodnight.
homeless_man Mister, can you help me out? Spare some change?
jesse_pinkman Hey. Come back. Yeah, you, I've got something for ya.
jesse_pinkman Yeah, here, take it. Go ahead. Just take it. Take it. Yeah.
dea_agent_scott Anything you want us to tell Steve Gomez? He says he's worried about you.
hank_schrader Yeah, tell him I already got two grandmas. So tell everybody more work and less worry.
dea_agent_artie I guess we better hit it.
dea_agent_scott Yeah.
walter_white *to agents* Hey guys, good to see you.
walter_white How are you, it's good to see ya.
dea_agent_scott How are you doing?
walter_white Good. Hey, how's your son doing, by the way? I was thinking about that.
dea_agent_scott Oh, it's back to 100%. He's goin' to district.
walter_white That's gotta be exciting. When is it, this Saturday?
dea_agent_scott This Saturday morning. I think the first pitch is at 10 A.M. so, uh...
walter_white I've gotta come, I'll be there. Should be a good crowd.
dea_agent_scott Yeah, yeah, it'll be fun. You gotta bring
hank_schrader *to agents* Guys, you're still on the clock here, let's go!
walter_white Alright Artie, see you Scott. Be well.
walter_white *to Hank* They're good guys, huh?
hank_schrader Yeah, they're good guys.
walter_white Well, it's good to see you up and about.
hank_schrader Yeah.
walter_white How you feeling?
hank_schrader Well, you know, been better, but...
walter_white Did you get to see a doctor? I mean, when one of these things lasts more than three days you really should get that checked.
hank_schrader Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did and I'm fine, I'm, uh, what they say on the upswing, you know.
walter_white Oh, good. Good to hear.
hank_schrader Yeah.
walter_white When I heard you weren't going into work, I…well, it looks like you've got the work coming to you. Perks of being the boss, huh?
hank_schrader Eh, you know. How's things at the car wash?
walter_white Good.
hank_schrader Yeah?
walter_white Really good. Hey, did you have any of that potato salad?
hank_schrader I don't know, maybe.
walter_white Yeah, I mean no one else got sick so I probably shouldn't worry about it. Well, Skyler will be very happy to hear you're feeling better. Which reminds me, I better get back to it. If there's anything I can do. Feel better.
walter_white You know. You're gonna laugh, but I have to ask you about this.
walter_white Believe it or not I found this on my car. I mean, it looks just like the GPS tracker that we used on Gus Fring, doesn't it? Back when we were tracking him just the two of us. You wouldn't know anything about this, would you, Hank?
walter_white You okay? I gotta say I don't like the way you're looking at me right now.
walter_white Hank.
hank_schrader It was you. All along it was you! You son of a bitch. You drove into traffic to keep me from that laundry.
walter_white Calm down.
hank_schrader That call I got telling me Marie was in the hospital. That wasn't Pinkman. You had my cell number. You killed ten witnesses to save your sorry ass. You bombed a nursing home. Heisenberg? Heisenberg. You lying, twofaced sack of shit.
walter_white Hank. Look, I don't know where this is coming from Hank, but just
hank_schrader I swear to Christ, I will put you under the jail.
walter_white Just take a breath, okay, just listen to yourself. These wild accusations, they could destroy our family. And for what?
hank_schrader You don't give a shit about family!
walter_white Hank, my cancer is back.
hank_schrader Good. Rot, you son of a bitch.
walter_white I'm sorry you feel that way. I want to beat this thing, I do. I'm back on chemo and I am fighting like hell. But the truth is, in six months you won't have someone to prosecute. But even if, somehow, you were able to convince anyone that I was capable of doing these things, you and I both know I would never see the inside of a jail cell. I'm a dying man who runs a car wash, my right hand to God that is all that I am. What's the point?
hank_schrader Have Skyler bring the kids here. And then we'll talk.
walter_white That is not going to happen.
hank_schrader I don't know who you are. I don't even know who I'm talking to.
walter_white If that's true, if you don't know who I am, then maybe your best course would be to tread lightly.
